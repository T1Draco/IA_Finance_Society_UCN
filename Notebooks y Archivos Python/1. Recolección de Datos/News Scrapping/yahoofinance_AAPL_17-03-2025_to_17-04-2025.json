        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAmong the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) have found themselves at the forefront of Trump's trade war.\nThis week, for better and worse.\nThe two tech stocks' volatility sinceTrump's \"Liberation Day\" reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2is one of the more salient examples of how investors are battling through ever-changing aggressive trade rules from the administration.\nApple was initially the biggest loser from the trade rules, with some 90% of its iPhones made in China, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. The companyled Big Tech stocks downin the days following Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2, shedding as much as $773 billion from its market cap.\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\nAtariff exemption for some consumer electronics— covering basically all of Apple's products — announced late last Friday by US Customs and Border Protectionrelieved some pressure on the stock earlier this week, with shares of the iPhone maker rising more than 2% Monday.\nApple's recovery helped stem its market cap losses andbriefly put its value back above $3 trillion.\nNvidia was less fortunate this week.\nThe company disclosed late Tuesday that the US government has effectively banned exports of its specialized chips to China,sending shares down nearly 7% on Wednesday.\nThough the AI chipmaker has lost a lower share of its value than Apple since April 2, most of the pain came this week as the company's market cap dropped 8%, or $230 billion. Over that same period, Apple stock was down only fractionally.\n\"In our view, this recent development heightens investor uncertainty in an already highly-uncertain environment,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in an analysis Wednesday.\nTrump so far has enacted a 10% tariff on all global imports, which went into effect on April 5.\nHis \"reciprocal\" tariffs initially set to take effect April 9 werepaused for 90 days, with the exception of a145% duty on Chinese imports.\nMore uncertainty lies ahead too.\nThis week, Trump set the stage to tariff semiconductors after news of exemptions for tech products:The Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chipsunder a law that grants the president the ability to impose levies on imports due to national security.\nAnd Trump has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs, which could hurt Nvidia, Apple, and other Big Tech firms.\n\"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nNetflix (NFLX)reported first quarter earningslate Thursday that topped expectations and solidified its position as a defensive player in an industry grappling with economic uncertainty tied to President Trump’s trade war, according to Wall Street analysts.\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called Netflix the \"cleanest story in internet\" in a client note following the results.\n\"Netflix has won the global streaming race, as further evidenced by these results,\" Pivotal Research's Jeff Wlodarczak added in a separate note on Thursday. \"Even in a global recession scenario, NFLX is likely to be highly resilient given the price-to-value of the service remains very attractive.\"\nBoth analysts raised their price targets on Netflix stock following the results. Shares of the streamer rose 3.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday; markets were closed Friday for Good Friday.\nThe stock's resilience is a standout in the tech landscape as rising costs, regulatory pressures, tariff whiplash,and a potential slowdown in advertising revenuehave weighed on shares of many Big Tech leaders this year.\nDuring the earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company was closely monitoring consumer sentiment amid tariff-related uncertainty but had seen no significant changes in its business performance.\n\"We're paying close attention clearly to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving,\" Peters said. \"But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.\"\nBank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich said Netflix remains \"predictable in an unpredictable world.\"\nThe analyst, who maintained her Buy rating and $1,175 price target, cited the company's positive subscriber and earnings momentum, along with evolving growth opportunities inadvertisingandlive events.\nNetflix guided to revenue for the current quarter above Wall Street expectations and reiterated its full-year 2025 revenue growth forecast of $43.5 billion-$44.5 billion.\nPeters noted subscriber retention remains \"stable and strong,\" with no noticeable uptick in cancellations or shifts toward lower-cost ad-supported plans following recent price hikes in key markets like the US and Canada. On Thursday, the company also announced it would be raising prices in France.\nPeters added that entertainment, in general, has proven to be resilient during tough economic times, and that \"Netflix specifically also has been generally quite resilient.\"\nEarlier this year,the company raised subscription pricesacross its various streaming tiers in the US, including the ad plan, which still remains one of the cheapest tiers on the market at $7.99 per month.\nNetflix is currentlyone of the strongest performersamong Big Tech, with its stock up 9.2% this year through Thursday’s close.\nThat’s a sharp contrast to the steep declines of 17% or more for itslarger tech peers, includingApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL).

Now, they're seeing their wallets take a major hit thanks to his policies.\nApple (NASDAQ:APPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave millions of dollars to Trump's reelection campaign and inauguration fund. ButCNNnow reports that as of April 9, the companies have lost a combined $1.8 trillion due to tariffs.\nDon't Miss:\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target –Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26\/share!\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump talked about how eager he was to grow the tech industry and cement America as a leader in AI. So it follows that the country's tech giants would want to hitch their trains to Trump's. But with tariffs targeting supply chains and manufacturing hubs across Asia, those once-hoped-for business benefits have failed to materialize. In their place are substantial monetary losses for both the companies and their respective CEOs and founders.\nInvestment bankUBSnow estimates that tech earnings as a whole could shrink by as much as 19%, according to a daily update it released on April 5. Wedbush Securities analystDan Ivescalled Trump's tariff policies an \"economic armageddon\" for the sector in an April 3 interview onCNBC.\nTrending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets.One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.\nBut what do those losses look like for the individual companies and the billionaires behind them? According to CNN,Elon Muskhas been hit the hardest. On April 12, theBloomberg Billionaires Indexshowed that the Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency de facto leader's personal net worth had dropped by $121 billion since the start of the year. And CNN writes that as of the market close on April 9, Tesla shares were down by 28% and its market capitalization had dropped by $376.6 billion.\nFollowing the market rebound on April 9, Meta CEOMark Zuckerberg's net worth had gone down by $14.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg list. This is a significant bounceback from the initial $26.5 billion loss that CNN reported the day before. His shrinking fortune still pales in comparison to the 2.25% loss in Meta's stock prices, which has caused a $35.8 billion decrease in the company's valuation.\nAmazon Executive ChairmanJeff Bezoshas seen a $33.3 billion decline in his net worth, according to Bloomberg, while CNN reports that his company experienced a 13% share price drop since the start of the year, which translates to a $316.8 billion loss in value.\nSee Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm —invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now.\nAnd while Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEOTim Cookhave seen their personal fortunes take less of a hit, their companies have not profited from their association with Trump the way they may have hoped. Google donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, but has seen tariffs contribute to a 16.2% drop in its stock prices and a $386.7 billion decline in its valuation, according to CNN. And Apple, having pledged a $500 billion investment in U.S. facilities, has taken an especially big hit, with stock prices hitting a low of 18.5% down from the start of the year, and total valuation declining by $684 billion.\nDuring Trump's first term in office, many big companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Tesla successfully lobbied for exemptions from Trump's tariffs. But this time around, things appear less certain for the tech giants. \"The magnitude of reciprocal tariffs levied by the U.S. poses profound financial risks to the technology industry and its extensive supply chain,\" Moody's Ratings wrote in anoteon April 8. \"We believe no tech industry subsector will go unharmed.\"\nRead Next:\nMaker of a life-changing asthma device with 12,000+ patients waiting, FDA clearance, and a 67% drop in attacks — nowtaking final investors at just $1.52 per share.\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets –with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26\/share!\nImage: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.Click now to access unique insightsthat can set you ahead in today's competitive market.\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis articleTech Leaders Who Backed Trump Have Lost $1.8 Trillion.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe stock market has been whipsawing as a result of new tariff announcements that add more complexity and uncertainty to the mix. While it appears as though President Donald Trump is enacting a more stabilizing approach with a temporary pause in place and exemptions for certain products coming into the U.S., investors are probably wondering about ways to protect their portfolios for whatever the future holds.\nIf you're worried about tariffs, it might be a good idea to identify stocks that possess this one phenomenal trait.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nImplementing tariffs basically increases costs that businesses face. The biggest fear among economists is that this will lead to inflationary pressures, as the higher costs are passed to consumers in the form of higher prices. People might already be aware of this possibility, as their expectations about the economy in the short term are at a 12-year low.\nWhile the ultimate effect of tariffs is unknown, with what seems like more questions than answers at this point, investors can focus their attention on ways of upgrading their portfolios. Maybe it's time to add stocks that provide a tariff buffer.\nWarren Buffett, the great investor who has compounded capital at a remarkable rate forBerkshire Hathaway, once said thatpricing poweris a characteristic of a wonderful business. Companies that can occasionally ask customers to pay more without worrying about losing them are in fantastic shape.\nApply this thinking to the current economic landscape. To be fair, no business can raise prices without limit. However, there are companies that have proven their pricing power.Coca-Cola, the beverage giant with a global presence, consistently raises prices on its products, betting that customers will stay loyal to the brand. This can offset muted unit volume growth.\nApplesells expensive devices that seem to always be in demand. Beautifully designed hardware mixed with easy-to-use software is a winning combination.Manufacturing supercars is an incredibly lucrative endeavor forFerrari. It offers vehicles that are basically viewed as collector's items, with perhaps the strongest pricing power out there.\nInvestors might not thinkCostco Wholesalehas pricing power because of its intense focus on selling merchandise at extremely low prices. But look at the company's growing membership base that just accepted an annual fee hike last year.Netflixalso has pricing power. The leadership team of the top video streamer has consistently increased subscription fees, especially in the U.S. and Canada. This hasn't prevented membership growth over the years.\nCoca-Cola, Apple, Ferrari, Costco, and Netflix are simply examples of companies that have historically increased prices on occasion. It would make sense for the everyday investor to at least understand and appreciate pricing power, particularly within the current uncertain macro backdrop.\nIt's important to keep in mind that these five stocks don't necessarily present smart buying opportunities right now. Valuation is a critical component that needs to be factored into the decision-making process. Pay too much, and returns could be disappointing.\nWith that in mind, all these stocks arguably trade at expensiveprice-to-earnings ratios. What's more, new developments surrounding tariffs could have more of a negative effect on some of these companies compared to others.\nIf valuation is less of a concern for you, then maybe it's best todollar-cost averageinto shares of Coca-Cola, Apple, Ferrari, Costco, Netflix, or any other companies with pricing power, over a 12-month span, for instance. This helps ensure that your portfolio consists of businesses that can pass higher costs to customers. It can also be beneficial to take advantage of many different price points when buying shares.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nThe surge came despite a 9% year-over-year decline in shipments across China, Apple's largest market. The company has now posted seven straight quarters of falling sales in the region, losing share even as the broader Chinese smartphone market grew 3.3%.\nIndia's growth was underpinned by affordability measures, including zero-interest installment plans and online retailer discounts. More than half the shipments were driven by the iPhone 16e, part of the latest product lineup that caters to cost-sensitive users.\nDespite overall weakness in India's smartphone market, Apple outpaced rivals and rose to fourth in market share.

But getting started is the hardest part, and these two stock picks -- using fractional shares offered by many online brokerages -- instantly give you a portfolio of businesses primed to benefit from the biggest growth market this century:artificial intelligence(AI).\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nMost people think ofAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)as an e-commerce giant. But its Amazon Web Services division -- more commonly referred to simply as AWS -- is arguably the company's biggest strength right now. This division is not only delivering big profits, but also provides Amazon with its biggest growth opportunity in years.\nWhat exactly does AWS do? It delivers on-demand cloud computing services. Think of it as a distributed computer. You can have entire applications run in \"the cloud,\" which essentially just means that AWS is running them on its services. This allows businesses like AI start-ups to scale up infrastructure fast without needing to purchase its own equipment. In a nutshell, you can think of AWS as a rental business that rents out processing and storage capabilities.\nWhat does this all have to do with artificial intelligence? AI applications require a lot of computing power to train and execute their models. Demand can be variable and fluctuate wildly. Cloud infrastructure allows this to occur seamlessly, scaling up and down depending on the businesses needs that day. If every AI company needed to purchase its own GPUs and build out its own infrastructure, innovation would crawl to a halt. With a 30% market share for cloud infrastructure worldwide, AWS is a top choice for many AI businesses.\nBuffett's holding company,Berkshire Hathaway, owns roughly $2 billion of Amazon shares. Considering AWS contributed roughly 75% of Amazon'soperating incomelast year, it's fair to say that Buffett and company have a lot staked on the AI economy through this position alone. But it's the next holding on this list that is truly a huge bet on AI.\nAs with Amazon, most investors don't think ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)as an AI company. That's because most of its sales and profits are still derived from hardware, things like iMacs, iPhones, and iPads. But a growing source of revenue for the company is in App Store sales. And this gives Apple a front row ticket to the rise of AI, no matter which AI service ultimately wins out.\nOver the first 65 days of 2025, the Apple Store generated $5.3 billion in revenue, up 14% year over year. Note that total revenue last quarter grew by just 4%. A huge amount of the App Store's growth has been fueled by AI applications like ChatGPT. Sales from AI applications like this jumped by roughly 50%. ChatGPT alone now has more than 45 million downloads, tripling its daily active users year over year.\nBank of Americarecently reaffirmed its \"buy\" rating on Apple stock due to the strength of its software and services segment, which includes App Store sales. While it can vary, Apple takes roughly 30% of any money paid to apps on its App Store. And because the App Store is the only official way to get applications into the hands of iPhone users, Apple maintains an immensely valuable place in the value chain.\nApple is currently the biggest position in Berkshire's portfolio, with a value of roughly $75 billion. But you don't need billions to bet on AI businesses like Amazon and Apple. Just $60 -- split evenly between both companies -- can get you started on the right path. Adding more funds later is far easier than putting your first dollars to work. Establish an initial position, maintain a long term perspective, and add additional funds whenever possible, even in small increments. Over time, even small additions can add up.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Don't make it complicated. Borrow a pick or two -- or more -- from the market's most proven stock picker. That's Warren Buffett, of course, chief investment guru ofBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which regularly outshines theS&P 500's long-term performance. Credit Buffett's stock-picking prowess, mostly.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three Buffett\/Berkshire holdings that would be good all-around picks for nearly investor.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nIt's such a frequently suggested pick that it's almost become cliché. Nevertheless,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)is a prospect that would be at home in almost everyone's portfolio.\nNot everyone will necessarily agree with this call. Revenue stagnated again following 2021's modest progress, in step with stagnating iPhone sales (which accounts for about half of the company's top line). Shares rallied last year on the belief that the company's newer artificial intelligence (AI)-capable smartphones would reignite growth. But, as it turns out, what the company's calling Apple Intelligence isn't quite the draw it was hoped. Indeed, the latest version of its AI-powered virtual assistant Siri can arguably be considered a flop that's since been sent back to the proverbial drawing board. The subsequent dent in the company's reputation is the big reason Apple shares are nowdown more than 20%from their late-2024 peak.\nDon't jump to long-term conclusions about this company's long-term future based on its near-term results, however. This is still Apple. While it was undeniably late to the AI party and admittedly launched the newest version of Siri before it was ready,artificial intelligencestill plays prominently in everyone's future.\nMarket research outfit Next Move Strategy Consulting predicts the consumer-facing sliver of the AI market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 28% through 2030, while Market.us believes the worldwide personal AI assistant market will grow at an average annual pace of 38% between now and 2034. People just need a little more education, and a little more time.\nThis tailwind of course bodes well for Apple.\nThis might convince you: Although Berkshire's been paring back its stake in Apple of late, at a value of $60 billion it's still by far the conglomerate's single biggest position, making up more than 20% of its stock holdings.\nWhile Apple is a name everyone's heard of,VeriSign(NASDAQ: VRSN)is anything but. It's not even a particularly big deal to Buffett and his lieutenants. Although Berkshire owns 14% of the company, with only 13.3 million shares worth a grand total of $3.3 billion, VeriSign only makes up 1.2% of Berkshire's holdings in publicly traded companies.\nStill, the fact that Buffett wants to own any size piece of VeriSign is telling,andbullish.\nIn simplest terms, VeriSign is the organization responsible for registering websites that end with a \".com\" and \".net\" suffix. It also handles \".cc\" and \".name\" sites, but dot-coms and dot-nets make up the bulk of world's websites. The company also offers a handful of cyber defense and technological solutions, but domain registrations are its big business.\nThere are registration fees involved, of course, albeit modest ones. The World Wide Web is also already pretty well crowded, with not a great deal of need for new sites. That's why single-digit revenue growth here is the norm.\nWhat VeriSign lacks in growth firepower, however, it more than makes up for in consistency. Revenue has grown every single quarter (year over year) for well over a decade now, in fact, while operating income has grown almost as a reliably, and certainly just as quickly. Plenty of companies envy this steady forward progress.\nIt makes sense, of course. After all, the internet is here to stay.\nVeriSign isn't a cheap stock, mind you. Indeed, thanks to a pronounced run-up since late last year the stock's trading at nearly 30 times this year's expected per-share earnings of $8.68, and within sight of analysts' consensus price target of $267.50. You could have gotten this stock at a lower price just a few months back. And you might be able to buy it cheaper at some point in the foreseeable future.\nAs Buffett reminds investors though, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" In other words, holding out for a bargain price often ends up hurting more than helping.\nFinally, it's a frequently glossed-over fact that Buffett doesn't directly own many -- if any -- of what are often called \"Warren Buffett stocks.\" These stocks in question are almost always just equities held by the Berkshire Hathaway company. The bulk of Buffett's personal wealth is instead actually tied up in the 15% (equivalent) of Berkshire that he directly holds, which of course means he onlyindirectly owns a piece of every so-called \"Buffett stock.\"\nThe thing is, you can do the very same for yourself. That is to say, you can own the very same sort of stake in Berkshire Hathaway that Buffett himself does. At a price of just over $500 apiece, in fact, a $1,000 investment would get you a couple of Berkshire's Class B shares.\nDoing so would certainly solve a lot of problems for investors looking for an easy, efficient way of buying and holding a Buffett-approved portfolio, too. Not only will you own a proportional stake in everything that Buffett and his lieutenants like, any changes they might make to Berkshire's holdings are automatically made on your behalf -- not unlike a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nIt's the other nuance, however, that makes this option a brilliant choice. That's the fact that holding a position in Berkshire Hathway shares means you own a stake in several dozen privately held cash-cow companies that make up roughly one-third of the conglomerate's total market cap. These include Clayton Homes, GEICO Insurance, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Pilot Travel Centers, and flooring company Shaw just to name a few. These cash-generating outfits play a crucial role in Buffett's bigger-picture strategy, which can sometimes include just accumulating a war chest while waiting for the right opportunity to present itself.\nThis strategy has proven brilliant time and time again, including recently. Despite being underinvested with than $100 billion worth of idle cash on the books since 2019 and more than $300 billion just since late last year, Berkshire shares have easily beaten the market over the course of the past three years, reclaiming their long-term lead as a result.\nThere's no reason to think the underpinning of this performance will be any different in the near or distant future either.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks surging on news today.\nIn the latest efforts to stop China from getting ahead in the AI race, the Trump administration is considering penalties that would block China’s DeepSeek from buying U.S. technology, reportsThe New York Times.It has also been reported that the administration is currently debating Americans’ access to its services. DeepSeek, a Chinese start-up that shook up Wall Street a few months ago with its cheaper and more efficient AI models, has had the US taking firm steps to tighten controls and scrutinize tech investments.\nA key focus of US export controls has been Nvidia, whose chips were used to build DeepSeek’s AI models. Even though the US had stringent export controls, the AI start-up managed to get hold of thousands of its GPUs, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the said controls. As a result, US officials now aim to prevent the most advanced chips from being sold to China to deter it from having a lead in the AI race.\nREAD NOW:12 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radarand10 AI Stocks You Shouldn’t Overlook Right Now\nThe U.S. House Select Committee on China said that “it has sent a formal letter to Nvidia demanding answers about sales to China and Southeast Asia to examine whether and how its chips ended up powering DeepSeek’s AI models—despite U.S. export restrictions”.\nWith the government tightening its export rules to China, the AI chipmaker has revealed how it would face a $5.5bn (£4.2bn) hit in costs. The company will now require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, one of its most popular chips.\n“The [government] indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.”\nThe company also said that federal officials have advised them that the licence requirement “will be in effect for the indefinite future”.\nAccording to Marc Einstein from the Counterpoint Research consultancy, the $5.5bn hit is in line with estimates.\n“As we have seen in the last few days and weeks, this may largely be a negotiating tactic. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some exemptions or changes made to tariff policy in the near future.”\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (see more details here).\ndavid-dvoracek-19-rJG0QENU-unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On April 17, Evercore ISI reiterated the stock as “Outperform” with a $250 price target. The firm said it is standing by the stock in the face of tariff headwinds. The firm acknowledged Apple’s heavy reliance on China but also talked about how the company is trying to diversify by shifting some iPhone production to India, and Wearables and Mac production to Vietnam. In the case tariffs move beyond China, the firm believes that it is still unlikely that Apple will begin production in the US.\n“Apple’s efforts to diversify its supply chain should help minimize the impact from tariffs that only target China. If tariffs are applied broadly, we think Apple would continue to import and push through relevant price increase to offset the cost inflation along with getting suppliers to share the burden.”\nOverall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of AI stocks surging on news today. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

At the time of the 2011 article, experts estimated that paying American wages would only add about $65 to each iPhone.\nThe real issue was China's supply chain dominance. \"You need a million screws? That factory is a block away,\" a former Apple executive told the Times.\nIn that same dinner, Jobs said that Apple could potentially bring some high-skill manufacturing to the U.S. if the government helped train engineers. But he was clear: America didn't have the mid-level engineering workforce or production speed needed to compete.\nTrending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets.One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.\nCurrent Apple CEOTim Cookhas tried to soften that stance.

But most iPhones are still made abroad.\nEven back in 2012, Cook pledged $100 million to build some Mac computers in the U.S. While this move garnered attention, analysts viewed it as a strategic decision rather than a significant shift in Apple's manufacturing strategy. Tom Dinges, a senior supply chain analyst at IHS,told Wiredthe impact would be minimal across Apple's global operations.\nBut more than a decade later, the conditions Cook once hedged against may be catching up.\nApple has started ramping up production in India, aiming for 25 million units this year, but China remains its manufacturing heart. As Trump pushes tariffs, Apple may be forced to test Jobs' theory — whether those jobs really are gone for good, or whether a $3,500 iPhone is what it takes to bring them home.\nRead Next:\nHasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm —invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now.\nWith shares starting at $1.52,this could be your chance to invest in the future of healthcare.\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.Click now to get top trade ideas daily, plus unlimited access to cutting-edge tools and strategies to gain an edge in the markets.\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis articleSteve Jobs Said 14 Years Ago iPhones Would Never Be Made In The U.S.: 'Those Jobs Aren't Coming Back'—Now Tariffs Could Bump Price To $3,500originally appeared onBenzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAs President Donald Trump’s enormous new tariffs on China rippled through global supply chains, Apple CEO Tim Cook went to work behind the scenes.\nCook spoke to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week about the potential impact of the tariffs on iPhone prices, two people familiar with the phone call said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations that were previously unreported. Cook spoke with other senior officials in the White House, the people said. And he refrained from publicly criticizing the president or his policies on national television, as many other executives have over the past several weeks.\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\nBy the end of the week, the Trump administration agreed to exempt from import duties electronic products that Apple produces in China, an action that also granted a reprieve to other large U.S. firms, including HP and Dell. Trump did so despite the recommendations of senior White House aide Peter Navarro, who had wanted the taxes to remain in place, the people said.\nSince the exemption was announced, Apple’s stock recovered roughly 7 percent of its value, although it later gave back some of those gains. The stakes for Apple are high; one estimate suggested that Trump’s 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports would have led Apple to charge more than $2,000 for iPhone Pros, according to Wedbush Securities.\n“Tim has a very good relationship with the president and rightly so. He has been playing a very careful role in that he obviously has a huge dependency on China but is also hugely important to the U.S.,” said Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary during Trump’s first term.\n“In general, he has a lot of respect because he’s not a public whiner, he’s not a crybaby, but comes with the real voice of reality. It’s no surprise to me that his suggestions are being well received.”\nAs Trump’s sprawling global trade war affects dozens of countries and thousands of companies, foreign leaders and executives are trying to prevent their products from getting hit. Their urgency has intensified as the scale of Trump’s tariffs has grown, setting off a lobbying frenzy in Washington as they race to minimize the potential financial damage. CEOs have descended on the White House and Mar-a-Lago in increasing numbers, with chip powerhouse Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google CEO Sundar Pichai among those visiting the president over the past several weeks.\nBoth publicly and privately, Trump has expressed a desire to oppose pressure from specific corporate interests or allied industries. He is described by advisers as strongly disliking the word “exemption,” which he believes enabled his advisers to weaken the tariff measures of his first administration. The Sunday after the exemptions were announced, several administration officials stressed that the electronics products would be included as part of tariffs on semiconductors, meaning Apple’s imports would be only temporarily exempted.\nThese assurances, however, did not obscure that Apple, along with several other tech firms, had won a significant victory on tariffs at a time when many companies have tried and failed to do so for products they say are necessary for their bottom lines. While the White House denies that the administration did any specific favors for Cook, Trump also said Monday that he “helped” the tech executive. “I speak to Tim Cook,” Trump told reporters Monday. “I helped Tim Cook recently, and that whole business.”\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said that the Trump administration had not granted “any exemptions” to benefit Apple or any other company. He also said the administration’s agenda will build on existing commitments by firms such as Apple, Nvidia and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to manufacture more in the United States.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\n“Electronics are now the subject of a Section 232 investigation, a completely separate legal authority that is not up for negotiation,” Desai said. “The administration is taking a nuanced, strategic approach to combat China’s unfair trade practices and reshore the high-tech manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security back to the U.S.”\nThe policy shift reflects what Trump allies describe as Cook’s effectiveness in navigating the White House and captures some of the tensions inherent in the president’s economic policies.\nCook joined other tech executives in personally giving more than $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, and people close to the president say he respects the Apple chief. When venture capitalist Marc Andreessen first met Trump at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, last year, the president-elect asked him what he thought of Cook, according to a separate person familiar with the dinner, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks. Andreessen responded that he was impressed by Cook’s leadership of the iPhone maker. Trump agreed and told Andreessen that he appreciated how Cook met with him directly with no intermediaries, which has not been previously reported.\nCook’s playbook for dealing with Trump has become a source of envy, and emulation, across much of the business world. During Trump’s first term, Cook joined Trump for one-on-one dinners and spoke to him directly. Those meetings paid dividends, and Trump agreed to pare back tariffs on China after a direct request from Cook.\nThough Apple, like other hardware makers, has made attempts to diversify its supply chain to Vietnam and India in recent years, 90 percent of its iPhone components are manufactured in China, according to Wedbush Securities estimates.\nSince the election, tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have followed a similar script, dining or meeting with Trump privately at the White House or at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida club. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) The frequent meetings mark a dramatic departure from the first term, when Trump often vilified or attacked these executives on Twitter.\nThe charm offensive appears to have changed Trump’s perception of some of the executives. Trump met with Pichai at the White House last month, according to a person familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, Trump told reporters: “I love Google, and I got to like the people that run it. Very capable people. They didn’t like me so much in the first administration, but they like me a lot now.”\nCook also appears to remain in the president’s good graces.\nTrump has imposed more than $2 trillion in tariffs since taking office, and much of them fall on products that have no chance of being produced in significant quantities in the United States, such as tomatoes and bananas, said Joseph Politano, an economic analyst at Apricitas Economics who has written extensively about the import duties. Politano also pointed out that video game systems - another form of consumer electronics - were not given a reprieve, though they also include semiconductor components. The semiconductor tariffs could take up to 270 days to implement - a lengthy process that could yield further changes.\nOther companies, such as Dell, benefit from some of the exceptions. But Lori Wallach, executive director of Rethink Trade at the American Economic Liberties Project, a left-leaning group that has been critical of Big Tech firms, pointed out that Apple appears to be the only company that benefits from virtually all of the new ones. (Wallach added that an eighth change exempted the machines used to make microchips, which did not appear to benefit Apple.)\n“When you look at the specific seven additional tariff lines that were added de novo relative to April 2 exception list, it just happens to all be the things Apple makes - and few other companies, if any, make all this stuff,” Wallach said.\nSome experts have defended the exemption as a logical recalibration after Trump raised the reciprocal tariffs on China to more than 100 percent. Daniel Kishi, a policy adviser at American Compass, a center-right think tank, said that the administration is harmonizing the various trade authorities it has brought to bear. Kishi said because devices such as iPhones include semiconductors, it makes sense for the semiconductor investigation to target the devices and for the tariffs to be set at the same rate as tariffs on semiconductors. Otherwise, companies will continue to import the assembled devices, and the incentive to produce semiconductors domestically would be reduced.\nTrump has also separately imposed 20 percent tariffs on all imports from China, which is affecting Apple’s products.\n“There was always going to be an investigation that covers consumer electronics as part of the semiconductor investigation,” Kishi said. He added: “Every other consumer electronics company similarly benefits from the short-term reprieve - it’s not like Apple was given a unique advantage relative to every other company.”\nWhatever the reason, some critics say it’s unfair for one of the world’s biggest and most powerful companies to win an exemption due to its size. Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, pointed to social science research on the topic showing that tariffs hurt domestic industries by requiring leadership to spend time on political lobbying rather than innovation.\n“It becomes clearer by the day that there is no grand strategy to Trump’s disastrous trade policies, and if you’re a CEO, the only way out of the chaos is to pay up,” said Alex Jacquez, who served as a senior trade official in the Biden administration and now works for the Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank. “Meanwhile, manufacturers and small businesses that can’t afford million-dollar donations are going to start to fold.”\nRelated Content\nJa Morant dares the NBA to punish him, knowing it won’t pull the trigger\nScientists are ‘X-raying’ the Amazon, unlocking a lost human history\nThe Smithsonian could be the beginning of Trump’s plan to edit history.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAmerica’s Treasury secretary has launched a fight to save the Federal Reserve’s chairman after Donald Trump declared his “termination cannot come fast enough”.\nScott Bessent has urged officials not to move against the central banker, according to Politico, for fear of further destabilising financial markets.\nMr Trump has privately discussed firing Jerome Powell for months and replacing him with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night.\nThe US president launched an attack on Mr Powell yesterday, arguing the official “should have lowered interest rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now”.\nMr Trump’s complaints came after the Fed chairman indicated he is in no rush to cut US interest rates from the current level of 4.5pc, particularly given the tariffs unleashed on “liberation day” will raise prices for American households.\n“The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” Mr Powell said.\nThe president called for the Fed chairman to go in a post on his Truth Social website, claiming the chairman is “always TOO LATE AND WRONG”.\nAsked about the comment at the White House, Mr Trump insisted he couldforce out the independent head of the Fedand once again attacked the central bank chief for his policy on interest rates.\n“He’ll leave if I ask him to, he’ll be out of there,” the president told reporters. “I’m not happy with him. I let him know and if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.”\nMr Trump appointed Mr Powell to the post in his first term as president. His criticism of the official now raises concerns for the future of the independence of the central bank and its ability to set interest rates based on economic conditions rather than political expedience.\nThe Fed chairman has long stated he does not believe the president has the power to oust him before his term at the central bank ends in May of next year.\nHowever, he said he is “monitoring carefully” a forthcoming Supreme Court case regarding the firing of officials in other regulatory agencies.\n“I don’t think that decision will apply to the Fed but I don’t know,” Mr Powell said at an event in Chicago.\nMr Trump’s call for the Fed to lower interest rates came as the European Central Bank yesterday cut eurozone interest rates to 2.25pc. Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said the “economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty” as exporters face “new barriers to trade” amid the trade war.\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund added to the warnings. Krista­lina Georgieva said the global economic watchdog will slash its growth forecasts for the world next week when it publishes new projections including the impact of the US president’s tariffs on imports from almost the entire world.\nShe said: “Our new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession. We will also see mark-ups to the inflation forecasts for some countries. Trade policy uncertainty is literally off the charts.”\nMs Georgieva highlighted “ships at sea not knowing which port to sail to; investment decisions postponed; financial markets volatile; precautionary savings up”.\nIt comes as the Government scrambles to find a way to spare Britain from the worst effects of tariffs. Rachel Reeves said she will have “conversations with the US administration” next week as she visits Washington DC for the IMF’s annual meetings.\nThe Chancellor said: “We are in active negotiations at the moment with our US counterparts on a whole range of issues concerning the tariffs for steel and aluminium, and the cars which of course are at 25pc, as well as the headline tariff rate of 10pc.”\nWhite House officials believe a trade deal with Britain can be finalised within three weeks. JD Vance, the US vice-president, has said Mr Trump will agree a “great” trade deal because of his “cultural affinity” with Britain.\nRead the latest updates below.\nThanks for joining us on this live blog. That’s all for today.\nYou canread all the latest news, analysis and commentary about business and economics here.\nThe S&P 500 rose on Thursday, lifted by drug giant Eli Lilly and Apple, as investors weighed up progress in US trade negotiations with Japan, on the one hand, against concerns about higher for longer interest rates.\nIn preliminary data for the day, the S&P was up 1.1pc at its close 9pm, while the Nasdaq fell 0.1pc and the Dow Jones fell 1.3pc.\nEli Lilly surged 16% after the drugmaker said its experimental pill worked as well as blockbuster drug Ozempic to lower weight and blood sugar in a trial of diabetes patients.\nApple climbed 2pc, with the iPhone recovering from some of its recent deep losses.\nHowever, the Dow was pulled down by health giant UnitedHealth falling 22pc.\nDonald Trump has spent months privately talking about firing the Fed chairman, according to a report.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the US president has held meetings at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on whether to attempt to oust Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026. However, sources said that he has not yet made a final decision.\nThe paper said that Mr Trump had spoken to Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, among others. Mr Trump reportedly has considered appointing Mr Warsh to the role.\nWall Street is rising this evening on its final day of trading in a holiday-shortened week.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is up 0.8pc and the Nasdaq is up 0.4pc. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of 30 leading US companies, is down 0.8pc after one of its members, UnitedHealth, plunged 23pc.\nThe health care giant reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts’ expectations, and it also slashed its forecast for financial results this year.\nUncertainty still remains high about tariffs, but Donald Trump today offered some encouraging signals that negotiations with other countries could lead to lower tariffs, which is what Wall Street is hoping for.\n“Had a very productive call with the President of Mexico yesterday,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “Likewise, I met with the highest level Japanese Trade Representatives. It was a very productive meeting. Every Nation, including China, wants to meet!”\nKristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has said that the US and China need to reduce uncertainty and agree on a fairer, rules-based trading system.\nMs Georgieva, speaking at an event in Washington, said: “This feeling of unfairness in some places fits the narrative, ‘we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty.’”\nShe said that both the US and China had grievances around trade rules, but added: “We would like to see a reduction in uncertainty, and it is hard to get there if the two largest economies are still finding their footing and when, obviously, from the perspective of the world economy, it is important that the result of all this is a more, fairer, rule-based system.”\nDonald Trump has suggested that it is up to him whether Jerome Powell stays as Fed chairman.\n“He’ll leave if I ask him to, he’ll be out of there”, the US president said.\n“I’m not happy with him. I let him know it and, if I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me.”\nApple chief Tim Cook had a phone call with Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, last week about the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on iPhone prices, The Washington Post has reported.\nMr Cook also reportedly spoke with other senior figures in the White House. By the end of the week, Mr Trump had agreed to exempt some tech products including smartphones and computers from his tariffs on China.\nWilbur Ross, who was commerce secretary during Mr Trump’s first term, told the paper: “Tim has a very good relationship with the president and rightly so. He has been playing a very careful role in that he obviously has a huge dependency on China but is also hugely important to the US.\n“In general, he has a lot of respect because he’s not a public whiner, he’s not a crybaby, but comes with the real voice of reality. It’s no surprise to me that his suggestions are being well received.”\nThe Telegraph has approached Apple and the US Department of Commerce for comment.\nThe FTSE 100 index has posted its biggest weekly gain since October 2022 today, ahead of the Easter break.\nHowever, the index closed flat after quiet trading today.\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 index closed this afternoon down 0.1pc, but was also higher on the week, with the biggest such jump since January.\nEuropean shares have closed slightly lower after the European Central Bank eased borrowing rates as expected.\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index ended 0.1pc lower, although they clocked a roughly 4pc weekly jump in a holiday-shortened week.\nTrading volumes were relatively small on Thursday ahead of a four-day weekend on account of Good Friday and Easter Monday.\nThe European Central Bank cut interest rates for the seventh time in a year, bringing its key rate to 2.25pc in a move to prop up confidence as tariffs curb trade.\n“With so much uncertainty and inflation finally returning to target, the last thing the ECB wants to do is loosen too early and jeopardise that trajectory,” HSBC economists said.\n“And while looser policy can help counter a global slowdown, it can’t do much to influence US trade policy or fix any associated damage to supply chains, or even push firms to borrow more to invest despite the uncertainty.”\nAnalysts have pared their forecasts for European corporate profitability as tit-for-tat tariffs have dimmed the global growth outlook, triggering market volatility that is reminiscent of the early days of Covid-19.\nThe Stoxx 600 is down about 10pc from its March record closing high, and more than 5pc down from levels seen before Trump’s now-delayed reciprocal tariffs sparked a global market rout.\nEuropean governments urgently need to ease tensions with the United States over Donald Trump’s tariffs, luxury goods billionaire Bernard Arnault has said, adding it would be “Brussels’ fault” if no solution is found.\n“European countries should try to manage these negotiations, and not leave them to bureaucrats,” the boss of LVMH told shareholders.\n“Europe is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalise our business sectors.”\nMr Arnault linked current market turmoil to global trade tensions and said LVMH’s business would suffer.\nUS tariffs could include a 20pc charge on European fashion and leather goods and 31pc for Swiss-produced watches if fully applied. Last week, Mr Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs on most countries for 90 days, but maintained a general 10pc levy.\nIn January, Mr Arnault - who is France’s richest man - praised Trump for boosting economic growth and entrepreneurship and referred to a “wind of optimism” after attending his inauguration.\nSince then, investor concerns over the possible economic damage of Trump’s trade policies have dragged LVMH’s shares 36% lower, reducing the group’s market capitalisation by more than 100 billion euros ($114 billion).\nFrance’s LVMH has for decades been the world’s dominant luxury group - known for products such as Moët & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes - but this week lost its title as the world’s largest luxury company to rival Hermès.\nDonald Trump has said he is in “no rush” to reach any trade deals because of the revenues his tariffs are generating, but suggested that it would be easy to find an agreement with the European Union.\nWhile meeting with Italian premier Giorgia Meloni at the White House, he talked up the chances of cutting a tariff deal for the European Union.\n“I’m sure we can make a deal, and I’m here to help with that,” Ms Meloni told reporters.\nMr Trump said he “100pc” believed Washington and Brussels could reach a deal but added it had to be a “fair deal”.\nMs Meloni has criticised Mr Trump’s “wrong” 20pc duties on EU exports - which he later suspended for 90 days - but has looked to maintain ties with the US president despite the chaos caused by his tariffs.\nDescribed by Mr Trump as a “fantastic leader” who shares many of his conservative views, Ms Meloni is the first European leader to meet with Trump since his trade war with the bloc began.\nRead our live blog on Giorgia Meloni’s meeting at the White House here.\nGlobal markets are calmer today after traders took some heart from trade talks between the US and Japan.\nHowever, the positive mood was curbed by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell saying the Fed would be cautious about cutting interest rates.\nWith a holiday weekend ahead, investors were reluctant to make big bets.\nDonald Trump unexpectedly joined talks in Washington on Wednesday with a delegation from Japan, saying later that “big progress” had been made in the discussions with lead Japanese negotiator Ryosei Akazawa.\nMr Trump gave no details, but it did give some support to those investors betting that some of the effects of tariffs will be negotiated away in time.\nThe S&P 500 is up 0.6pc, the Nasdaq is up 0.2pc and the Dow Jones is down 0.9pc.\nBritain’s FTSE 100 closed flat, while France’s Cac 50 fell 0.6pc and Germany’s Dax fell 0.5pc.\nScott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, has reportedly told the White House not to fire Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nSacking the Fed chairman would risk destabilising financial markets, Mr Bessent has repeatedly cautioned, according sources who spoke to Politico.\nDonald Trump has frequently lashed out at Mr Powell, who he appointed to lead the central bank in 2018. On social media this earlier today, the US president wrote: “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”\nHe said Mr Powell “is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’ Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now.”\nDespite repeatedly criticising the Fed chairman, an aide told CNN last November that Mr Trump was prepared to let Mr Powell see out his term ending in May 2026.\nAt the time, Mr Powell said he would refuse to resign if Donald Trump asked him to step down, adding that being fired by the president was “not permitted under the law”.\nThe comments came after reports that Mr Trump’s aides had drawn up a range of proposals for how monetary policy could be run in a second Trump administration, including rolling back the independence of the central bank and ousting Mr Powell.\nEconomists believe that independent central banks, such as the Fed and the Bank of England, give markets confidence and promote economic stability. The Fed is accountable to the US Congress, rather than Mr Trump personally.\nDuring last year’s US election campaign, Mr Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris, said: “The Fed is an independent entity, and as president, I would never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.”\nBut Mr Trump has argued that the Fed is making the wrong choices on interest rates.\nEarlier this month, Mr Trump publicly demanded that Mr Powell cuts interest rates “and stop playing politics!”\nRachel Reeves has said she will be having “conversations with the US administration” next week as the UK looks to secure a trade deal with Washington.\nAsked whether the UK is within three weeks of securing a trade deal with the US, the Chancellor told broadcasters: “Those conversations with our US counterparts are ongoing.\n“I will be in Washington next week for the International Monetary Fund annual meetings, their spring meetings.\n“I will also be having conversations with the US administration whilst I’m there.\n“The key thing for the British Government is always acting in the UK’s national interest, and any deal that’s able to be secured will always have front-and-centre British national interest.”\nAsked whether any deal could see the 10pc US tariff on goods lifted, she said: “We are in active negotiations at the moment with our US counterparts on a whole range of issues concerning the tariffs for steel and aluminium, and the cars which of course are at 25pc, as well as the headline tariff rate of 10pc.”\nShe added: “Getting a deal across a whole range of areas... (is) very important for British industry and British jobs, and that is my focus as Chancellor.”\nSwiss watch exports to the key US market soared nearly 14pc in March, as retailers raced to stock up before Donald Trump announced his tariffs on countries worldwide.\nAnalysts have warned that Switzerland’s watchmaking industry could be among the hardest hit by the 31pc import levies for Swiss goods announced in early April - although they have since been paused for 90 days.\nBut a baseline 10pc tariff on all US imports still took effect on April 5.\nIn March, Swiss watch exports to the United States jumped 13.7pc compared to a year earlier, rebounding after a 6.7pc drop the previous month, the country’s watchmakers’ federation said.\n“We believe the 14pc increase in US exports is significantly inflated by the tariff chaos, as earlier shipments overseas had already begun weeks ago,” said Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy.\nThe United States has been the biggest market for Swiss watches since 2021, overtaking Hong Kong and China, which had long been the top markets for the industry.\n“The US exports probably reflect Swiss producers pushing product and US retailers pulling ahead of US tariffs in April,” said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux.\nBut he warned that “every indication out there points to a slowdown in the US market”.\nWall Street and European stock markets are a mixed picture this afternoon as traders look towards and extended Easter weekend.\nMarkets on both sides of the Atlantic will be closed tomorrow, but David Morrison, an analyst at Trade Nation, noted that “Mr Trump doesn’t ‘do’ weekends. So tariff updates can come at any time”.\nThe S&P 500 is up 0.4pc, the Nasdaq is down 0.1pc and the Dow Jones is down 1.1pc.\nThe FTSE 100 is flat, while France’s Cac 40 is down 0.5pc and Germany’s Dax is down 0.5pc.\nThe number two in the Chinese government, Li Qiang, has hinted at a new economic stimulus package after saying that officials need to shore up market confidence at “critical moments”.\nMr Li told a session of the State Council today that officials “must harness the strength of policies, dare to step outside the norm when needed, and deliver a well-coordinated policy mix to ensure the market truly feels the benefits”.\nWhile China’s economy showed surprising strength in the first quarter, many economists have marked down the outlook for the rest of the year thanks to the US tariff hikes being imposed by Donald Trump.\nChina’s annual GDP climbed 5.4pc according to figures during the last quarter, thanks in part to Beijing’s consumer subsidies, along with an export surge to get ahead of the tariffs.\nEconomists at UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Societe Generale have lowered their forecasts for the country’s 2025 growth in recent weeks, to around 4pc or lower.\nBut Mr Li said the government should “at critical moments act early and swiftly, with various measures to positively shape market expectations.”\nDonald Trump’s trade war will hurt global growth and send inflation surging, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned.\nKristalina Georgieva said the global economic watchdog will slash its growth forecasts for the world next week when it publishes new projections including the impact of the US President’s tariffs on imports from almost the entire world.\n“Our new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession. We will also see markups to the inflation forecasts for some countries,” she said.\n“Trade policy uncertainty is literally off the charts.”\nUncertainty itself harms growth, the managing director said, as it results in “ships at sea not knowing which port to sail to; investment decisions postponed; financial markets volatile; precautionary savings up.”\nBorder taxes then hit economies by pushing up costs of goods and of components used by factories. And over time, productivity is undermined by a lack of competition for businesses and a lack of choice for customers.\nThe scale of Mr Trump’s tax rises, and the response from nations including China, are also particularly fearsome.\n“Putting together all the recent tariff increases, pauses, escalations, and exemptions, it seems clear that the US effective tariff rate has jumped to levels last seen several lifetimes ago. Other countries have responded,” she said.\nCarnage in markets risks a financial crunch.\n“Protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial market stress. Earlier this month, we saw unusual movements in some key bond and currency markets,” said Ms Georgieva, noting the fall in the dollar and rise in US Government borrowing costs. “Such movements should be taken as a warning. Everyone suffers if financial conditions worsen.”\nThe IMF boss acknowledged that not everyone has benefitted equally from globalisation in recent decades, with the US typically more open to imports than the average country and China ramping up subsidies and other protectionism more than the EU or America since the financial crisis.\nBut she said the main blocs must all change their ways to balance the global economy, including China boosting consumption, America cutting borrowing, and the EU raising defence spending and improving its competitiveness.\nNvidia shares fell further today, losing as much as 3.6pc, a day after Donald Trump’s trade war caused them to plunge 6.9pc.\nIt followed a decision by the US president to curb further the sales of artificial intelligence chips to China, which Nvidia said would hit earnings by $5.5bn (£4.2bn) this quarter.\nStephen Innes, of SPI Asset Management, said that the result of the Mr Trump’s latest move was that “traders got smacked ... and markets buckled hard”.\n“Big Tech - the supposed fortress of cash flow - was the casualty ... with Nvidia and its peers eating a face-full of policy shrapnel. China might be the target, but let’s be real: US firms are getting caught in the crossfire”.\nNvidia generated $17bn in China in 2024, 13pc of its total sales.\nBritain’s Armed Forces have banned electric vehicles (EVs) from some high-security military sites over fears that Chinese software embedded in them could be used for spying.\nTheFinancial Times reportedworkers at RAF Wyton, which is home to the National Centre for Geospatial Intelligence, have been told not to park EVs near the base.\nIn a written Parliamentary question, Lord Coaker, the defence minister, said: “Our policies and procedures take account of the potential threats from all types of vehicle, not just those manufactured in China, and we have issued appropriate internal direction to all drivers and passengers.”\nIt comes as Chinaramps up its sales in the UK market, with Auto Trader predicting the Chinese-branded models could win up to 25pc of the British EV market by the end of the decade.\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Protecting national security is the foundation of everything we do. We have strict security procedures in place to ensure all sensitive information is protected.”\nThe boss of Nvidia said China was a very important market for the chip giant after the US imposed a ban on sales of its H20 artificial intelligence technology to the world’s second largest economy.\nJensen Huang said his company hoped to “continue to cooperate with China” during a meeting with with the head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to state broadcaster CCTV.\nHe had arrived in Beijing earlier in the day at the invitation of the trade organisation.\nVice premier He Lifeng told Huang that China would welcome more US companies, including Nvidia, to further explore the Chinese market.\nHis visit comes as the US put new restrictions on China-bound shipments of Nvidia’s H20 datacentre GPUs, the only compliant AI chip the company can sell legally to China.\nThe European Central Bank will continue cutting interest rates at its next meeting in June, according to economists, after warning about the threat from tariffs.\nMark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said: “The forwarding-looking view on the economy implies an expected shock from tariffs, and the characterisation of ‘exceptional’ uncertainty, implies an openness to further monetary easing assuming the trade shock persists and is borne out in the data.\n“We continue to expect another rate cut in June and a terminal rate of 1.5pc by year-end.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped sharply at the opening bell after insurance giant UnitedHealth issued a profit warning.\nUnitedHealth’s shares tumbled 18pc after the company lowered its forecast for the year, pushing the Dow down 462.72 points, or 1.1pc, to 39,206.67.\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher amid trade talks between the US and Japans.\nThe benchmark US stock index rose 29.8 points, or 0.6pc at the open to 5,305.45, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 92.8 points, or 0.6pc, to 16,399.973.\nChristine Lagarde said she cannot know whether the European economy has hit the “peak of uncertainty” amid the rapid changes in Donald Trump’s trade war.\nThe ECB president warned there is a “degree of unpredictability which adds to the uncertainty” in the wake of the US president’s “liberation day” tariffs, which he later put on a 90-day pause for all countries except China.\nShe said the central bank would have to “stand ready for the unpredictable”.\nPointing out that interest rate decisions are made every six weeks, she said: “Think of the number of changes that have happened in the last six weeks”.\nThe ECB president said she expects Europe to receive goods from countries subject to higher tariffs from the US.\nChristine Lagarde said at her press conference: “There will be some redirection, rerouting of goods that will be supplied by markets that are subject to much higher tariffs, even as we speak now.”\nHowever, she said there was uncertainty over the course of action because there was “the prospect of something that could be far more impactful” and a “series” of possible responses that could be made on tariffs by the European Commission.\nShe said other factors at play as the ECB makes its next decisions on interest rates would be the recent rise in the value of the euro and the “significant decline in the price of commodities”.\n“Suffice to say, there will be a negative impact on growth and the net impact on inflation is less than clear.”\nShe added that the next ECB meeting would take place in June, before the end of Donald Trump’s 90-day pause of his “reciprocal” tariffs.\nChristine Lagarde said the impact of inflation would only become clearer over time but warned that it would be deliver a “negative demand shock”.\nThe ECB president said: “Looking at today and the tariffs debate that is going on, as well as the tariff impact, we know that it’s a negative demand shock.\n“We can anticipate that it will have some impact on growth but the net impact on inflation will only become clearer over the course of time.”\nShe said there were “diverging views over the short-term and the longer-term impact”.\n“We have a lot of uncertainty still today,” she said.\nHowever, she added that the decision to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point was unanimous, with “no-one to argue in favour” of a heftier half a point cut in the face of tariffs.\nChristine Lagarde said banks had loosened their credit standards as they became “more concerned about economic risks faced by their customers”.\nHowever, the ECB president insisted that the Governing Council which sets interest rates was “not precommiting to a particular rate path”.\nChristine Lagarde said geopolitical tensions remain a key source of uncertainty for the eurozone economy, which faces increasing risks to its growth outlook.\nShe said the disruption to caused to the global trading order had added to the uncertainty around the outlook for inflation.\nChristine Lagarde said the European economy had likely grown in the first quarter of the year.\nHowever, she said there was an urgent need to make the eurozone more competitive and resilient.\nShe said most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to the ECB’s 2pc target.\nChristine Lagarde said the “economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty” as exporters face “new barriers to trade” amid Donald Trump’s trade war.\nThe President of the European Central Bank warned consumers “may hold back spending” as the tariff war deepens.\nShe said the trade dispute had come just as European manufacturing “has shown signs of stability”.\nEconomists said the ECB’s commentary on its latest interest rate cut “clearly points to further policy easing to come”.\nAndrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said:\nThe statement says the outlook for growth has “deteriorated” due to “rising trade tensions”.\nThe value of the euro fell after the European Central Bank (ECB) said the outlook for growth “has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions”.\nThe single currency was last down 0.3pc against the pound to 85.8p and declined 0.4pc versus the dollar to $1.135.\nThe ECB dropped the word “restrictive” from its description of its interest rate policy, but also signalled that the European economy faces headwinds:\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates for the seventh time since last year amid worries that Donald Trump’s tariffs could hit economic growth.\nPolicymakers cut the deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25pc as inflation dropped to 2.2pc in March, close to the bank’s target of 2pc.\nThe ECB said in a statement that “the outlook for growth has deteriorated due to rising trade tensions”.\nIt cited “exceptional uncertainty” about the future economic situation, saying future rate decisions would be taken on a meeting by meeting basis.\nDonald Trump’s trade war will push down UK inflation and could speed up the pace of Bank of England interest rate cuts, economists have said.\nInflationdropped further than expectedfrom 2.8pc in February to 2.6pc in March as tariffs helped lower oil and petrol prices.\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the consultancy expects the pace of price rises to slow over the “growing likelihood of goods that were originally destined for the US turning up in the UK instead”.\nHe said the number of cargo ship visiting UK ports has risen much more sharply in the first few weeks of April than in April in the previous two years.\nAs a result, the Bank of England is more likely to look past any persistence in core or services inflation in Britain when it decides whether to cut interest rates, he said.\n“We still expect the Bank to slow the pace of rate cuts in August,” Dales said.\n“But if there is more evidence that core goods inflation is going to be lower, the Bank may cut rates from 4.5pc now to our long-held forecast of 3.5pc a bit earlier than by the middle of 2026.”\nJapan finance minister said he is “deeply concerned” about economic fallout from Trump’s tariffs, writesJulia Amann\nKatsunobu Kato issued the warning about the world’s fourth-largest economy after the first round of US-Japan trade talks got underway on Wednesday, which Donald Trump personally attended in Washington.\n“The recent US tariff measures affect various industries and heighten uncertainty,” he told Reuters.\n“We’re deeply concerned they could affect Japan’s economy, as well as the global economy, through various routes such as trade and financial markets.”\nKato said that during talks, Japan should explain how it can help the US reduce their huge trade deficit. The US had a trade deficit with Japan worth 9 trillion yen (£48bn) in the year to the end of March.\nTrump said on the social media platform Truth Social: “A great honour to have just met with the Japanese delegation on trade. Big progress!”\nJapan prime minister Shigeru Ishiba said the negotiations would not be easy, but that talks had “created a foundation for the next steps”.\nThe boss of BP said global energy demand would continue to rise despite the “short-term turbulence” caused by Donald Trump’s tariff trade war.\nThe oil giant’s chief executive Murray Auchincloss told shareholders at the company’s AGM that energy “is a growth market and demand has never been higher”.\nHe said: “There may be some short term turbulence, but we remain convinced the world needs more energy and we are one of a few that can provide that energy to the world as an integrated energy company.”\nAuchincloss said BP was now sourcing many of the materials it needed for its US operations, especially steel, from within the US to avoid tariffs.\nHe also made clear the scale of the company’s renewed commitment to surging oil and gas production, listing a series of new or expanded fossil fuel projects.\nHe told shareholders he planned to reverse BP’s decline in shareholder value relative to competitors like Shell.\nThe new or expanding projects include approval for 10 new upstream oil and gas projects,  developments in Iraq that would generate 3bn barrels of new oil.\nIn the Middle Eastm BP planned a natural gas joint venture with Adnoc.\nHe said: “We recognise the valuation gap between BP and our peers. We intend to close it. We’re going to be simpler and more focused.\n“Higher value and higher performing  We plan to increase oil and gas investment by a fifth to around $10bn a year.”\nThe FTSE 100 was on track for a strong weekly gain amid hopes for a trade deal between Britain and the US.\nBritain’s flagship stock index was up 3.2pc so far this week, despite a 0.7pc decline today ahead of the Easter break.\nThe Telegraph revealed that White House officials believe atrade deal with Britaincan befinalised within three weeks\nDefence stocks Rolls Royce and BAE Systems slipped 3pc and 2.6pc, respectively, weighing significantly on the FTSE 100.\nPrecious metals miners were down 1.1pc following eight consecutive days of gains amid surging gold prices..\nXi Jinping has called on Cambodia to “resist protectionism” and oppose “hegemonism” amid the onslaught of US tariffs.\nThe Chinese leader made the argument for collaboration in an article published in Cambodian media on Thursday, as Xi rounded off his Southeast Asia charm offensive tour with an appearance in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\nDonald Trump imposed a 49c “reciprocal” tariff on Cambodia earlier this month before pausing the levy until July, while China still faces combined levies of 145pc.\nCambodia has long relied on China, its largest creditor, to invest in its infrastructure projects and has spied opportunities for even closer ties, particularly over plans to build a 180km canal from the Mekong River to the coast of the Gulf of Thailand.\nOn the eve of Xi’s arrival, Meas Soksensan at the Cambodian finance ministry said: “We expect more cooperation including on infrastructure development.”\nXi has trumpeted the positive impact of the nations’ “ironclad friendship” and pledged to “unswervingly support” Cambodia’s development, but signed no new agreements on this trip.\nInstead, he delivered a parting swipe at Cambodia’s scam centres which often target Chinese nationals, either as victims or captive workers.\nDonald Trump launched an attack on the chair of the Federal Reserve after his warning that the US president’stariffs risked pushing up inflation.\nTrump said the departure of “Too Late” Jerome Powell, who he appointed during his first term in office, “cannot come fast enough” as he pushed for the US central bank to lower interest rates.\nThe President said Powell was always “too late and wrong” and urged him to lower borrowing costs, as the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to do at its meeting later today.\nThe Fed chairman had told the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday night that the US administration’s tariffs meant “inflation is likely to go up”, adding that the revenues from the tariffs would partially “come to be paid by the public”.\nTrump said Powell had issued a report “which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!’”\nHe posted on Truth Social: “Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting rich on tariffs.\n“Too Late should have lowered interest rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now.\n“Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”\nThe Fed’s benchmark interest rate stands at a range of 4.25pc to 4.5pc, where it has been since December following several rate cuts late last year.\nRestoring closer trade ties with the EU is “more important” to the wider UK economy than a bilateral deal with the US, an economist has said.\nShreyas Gopal of Deutsche Bank said while “mood music” on trade talks between the UK and the US was sounding “healthy”, it should not eclipse negotiations with the EU which will ramp up at the forthcoming summit in May.\nHe said: “The relative importance of UK goods trade with the US - and thus of a deal - shouldn’t be overstated, with total trade averaging around 4pc of GDP.\n“This compares to around 17pc of GDP for total UK goods trade with the EU.”\nMr Gopal said progress appeared to have been made with the bloc on defence, migration and regulatory alignment but it remained to be seen whether the UK could “thread this needle” between two trade warring allies.\nHe added: “Over the medium term, restoring closer trade ties with the EU is more important to the wider UK economy than the details of a bilateral deal with the US.”\nIn most quarters, the writing is already on the wall for the US economy.Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s boss, has said that a recession is “likely”, while Larry Fink, his counterpart at BlackRock, has warned that the downturn may have already begun.Such gloomy forecasts emerged after Donald Trump unleashed his global trade war, as many fear the US president’s tariffs will hammer growth and sting households.However, even after trillions of dollars were wiped off stock markets, Wall Street is not running for cover just yet.In fact, traders are gambling on the prospect of vast profits – despite Trump’s outlandish and erratic policy announcements.Read how Wall Street traders are spying opportunities amid the wreckage of the president’s trade war.\nThe euro declined against the pound and the dollar ahead of an expected cut to interest rates by the European Central Bank.\nThe single currency lost 0.2pc versus sterling to be worth 85.9p and was down 0.2pc against the greenback to $1.138.\nThe ECB is all but certain to cut interest rates for the seventh time in a year.\nIt comes as Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni heads to Washington for talks with Donald Trump aimed at cooling tensions over US tariffs against the EU.\nKenneth Broux, an analyst at Societe Generale, said: “It’s a bit of a Super Thursday for the euro, for the European bond market, but also for the European economy at large... it could be quite a pivotal moment.”\n“We’ll see if Meloni can extract maybe some concessions that lead us to a better kind of bilateral trade position ... if the trade position can somewhat be improved, that means that the ECB can be a little bit more relaxed.”\nEuropean shares fell ahead of the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision later today, where President Christine Lagarde will be asked about the impact of Donald Trump’s tariff policies.\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.5pc but remained on track for a 4pc climb this week.\nThe Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.2pc while the Cac 40 in Paris fell 0.3pc.\nFrance’s Hermes was last down 1.2pc after the Birkin bag maker posted a rare miss of analyst forecasts for quarterly sales, joining rival LVMH, which also reported sales below expectations earlier this week.\nSpirits maker Pernod Ricard dipped 0.5pc after reporting a fall third-quarter sales, partly hurt by tariffs.\nInvestors will listen to ECB president Christine Lagarde’s comments at a press conference after the central bank is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.\nEmmanuel Cau, an analyst at Barclays, said: “It’s too early for the ECB to really go much more aggressive on the dovish stance.\n“So we do expect cuts and a pretty balanced communication but we don’t think they will over-deliver on what the market is pricing in terms of rate cuts and guidance.\n“The market wants to see some progress on trade deals, whether it’s China, Europe or Japan and that will be more important than anything else.”\nTariff-induced uncertainty “will be the new Covid” and act as a scapegoat for companies’ underperformance, an economist has said.\nRonald J Epstein at Bank of America said the dust was settling on the initial shock from Donald Trump’s global tariff strategy, which spooked markets, angered trading partners and fuelled concerns over recession, stagflation and consumer demand.\nHe said: “While we expect most companies in our coverage to have a better pulse on 2Q, the second half of the year is laced with uncertainty.”\nMr Epstein warned investors that companies would likely err on the side of caution in delivering outlooks as it remained to be seen how the tariffs would impact supply chains, costs and consumer sentiment in the commercial aerospace and defence industry.\n“There are so many unknowns we expect company provided outlooks for the year ahead to be wide-spread (at best) and be fully recanted (at worst),” he said, adding: “Tariff uncertainty will be the new Covid.\n“While we appreciate the current environment is dynamic and incredibly hard to predict, we anticipate tariff uncertainty will be the scapegoat for company specific underperformance.”\nFrench luxury group Hermes said it would hike its prices in the US to offset the impact of 10pc import tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.\nThe group’s finance chief Eric Halgouet said the increases would take effect on May 1.\nHalgouet did not say by how much prices would be raised, but he said the move would “fully offset” the tariffs impact.\n“It will be a complementary price increase that we are currently finalising, but which will allow us to neutralise this impact,” he told reporters during a quarterly earnings presentation.\nHermes – famous for its Birkin handbag, silk scarves and leather goods – usually raises prices once a year and had already announced worldwide increase of between 6pc and 7pc earlier in 2025.\nIt overtook French rival LVMH as the world’s most valuable luxury group this week after the share price of the Louis Vuitton maker sank on disappointing earnings.\nHermes, also known for the “H” logo on its belts and other goods, posted global sales of €4.1bn euros (£3.5bn) in the first quarter of 2025, an 8.5pc increase from the same period last year.\nHowever, shares were down 2.4pc as earnings missed analyst expectations.\nBP faces a stormy AGM today against the backdrop of tariffs that have sent oil prices plummeting.\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, has plunged more than 11pc since Donald Trump announced his “liberation day” tariffs, which have triggered fears of a downturn in the global economy that would impact demand for oil and energy company profits.\nBP bosses were already expecting clashes between opposing shareholder groups over the company’s net zero U-turn, plus calls for the chairman to go.\nElliott, the US hedge fund, which holds 5pc of BP’s shares, is leading one group of investors demanding the oil major focus harder on energy production, efficiency and profits.\nEarlier this year, such pressure saw BP announce a drastic shift away from renewables in favour of investing more into oil and gas with chief executive Murray Auchincloss saying the oil major had gone “too far, too fast” on green energy.\nBut other pro-net zero shareholders were angered by the retreat. City giant Legal & General (L&G), also a major BP investor, is demanding the scalp of BP’s chairman over the oil giant’s retreat from net zero.\nThe FTSE 100 fund manager is refusing to support the re-election of chairman Helge Lund at today’s AGM, to be held at its campus in Sunbury, west London.\nLund has already said the next 12 months would be his last in charge but L&G wants him removed today and will vote against his re-election.\nThe move follows BP’s recent reversal of its 2020 commitment to green energy, which had included a tenfold increase in low-carbon investment and a 40pc reduction in fossil fuel production by 2030.\nOver the five years since then BP had seen its shares plummeting, leaving it increasingly exposed to foreign takeovers.\nLund originally supported that policy, however, a few weeks ago at BP’s capital markets day, he and chief executive Murray Auchincloss reversed it.\nL&G said it strongly opposed that decision which “represents a financially material and systemic long-term risk to our clients’ portfolios”.\nIt added: “We are deeply concerned by the recent substantive revisions made to the company’s strategy, coupled with the decision not to allow a shareholder vote on the newly amended climate transition strategy at the 2025 AGM.”\nL&G said it was pleased Mr Lund had decided to step down, but should not delay his departure till 2026.\nThe former deputy head of MI6 has warned the UK “would be in trouble” if it was to agree a trade deal with the US at the expense of China.\nThe Telegraph revealed that White House officials believe a trade deal with the UKcould be agreed “within three weeks”.\nNigel Inkster said such a deal could negatively impact the UK’s relationship with China, who is a “critical supplier” of pharmaceuticals in both the UK and the US.\nHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If it were the case that we had such a deal, I think it would come with strings, and one of those strings would be an expectation that the UK would get with the programme when it came to China.\n“We’ve seen a precursor of this with the Huawei 5G saga, which the Americans said, you cannot use a Chinese company to build the 5G. What needs to happen is that the Government needs to look much more carefully at what constitutes critical national infrastructure, and consider what the risks are in any given sector.\n“And one of the areas here that worries me quite a lot is the whole pharmaceutical sector, because China is a critical supplier of many pharmaceutical products. Without them, we would be in trouble.”\nAsked if the Chinese government could switch off the supply of vital pharmaceuticals in case of future dispute, Mr Inkster said: “It would be an incredibly powerful lever. China has, I think, a fairly clear track record of readiness to use economic coercion.”\nThe FTSE 100 fell at the start of trading after the chair of the Federal Reserve warned that US tariffs risked stoking inflation.\nThe UK’s blue-chip index dropped 0.6pc to 8,227.79 while the mid-cap FTSE 250 declined 0.3pc to 19,200.60.\nFord was said to be considering raising prices on new vehicles in May unless Donald Trump eases his tariffs against the car industry.\nThe US carmaker has privately warned American politicians that it will be forced to drastically raise prices if the 25pc tariffs against the sector remain in place, according to Automotive News.\nAn analysis by the Center for Automotive Research published earlier this month revealed that the duties on motoring imports implemented on April 3 will escalate costs for US carmakers by about $108bn (£81bn) this year.\nThe European Central Bank is all but certain to cut interest rates for the seventh time in a year later today as policymakers seek to prop up an already struggling economy that will take a large hit from US tariffs.\nThe ECB has been easing borrowing costs rapidly amid easing inflation and the recent turmoil on global markets.\nBut President Christine Lagarde is unlikely to offer many clues about the future, sticking instead to her line that uncertainty remains far too great for the bank to commit to anything, and it will decide its next steps as data is published.\nWhile Donald Trump has paused most tariffs, many remain in place and volatility in financial markets has already done damage.\nThe EU faces tariffs of 20pc if it does not reach an agreement with the US before President Trump’s 90-day suspension is over.\nJP Morgan economist Greg Fuzesi said: “Cutting the deposit rate 25 basis points to the top of (the neutral) range should be straightforward given the huge uncertainty and the likelihood that the trade war is not just a supply shock but will also likely hit demand.”\nDeliveroo has reported a pick-up in the rate of order growth and said it is still confident of hitting its profit guidance for the year, despite being “mindful” of growing economic uncertainty.\nThe delivery app said order growth sped up to 7pc in the first three months of 2025, an acceleration from 6pc in the final segment of last year.\nMeanwhile gross transaction value last year, meaning the total cost of people’s baskets plus delivery fees, was up 9pc compared with the same period in 2024.\nFounder Will Shu described it as a “strong start” to the year, adding: “We continue to have confidence in delivering our guidance for 2025 whilst, like many others, remaining mindful of the uncertain macroeconomic environment.”\nThe boss of Taiwan’s chipmaking titan TSMC insisted there had been no change in behaviour from customers since the start of Donald Trump’s tariff war as it left its profit forecasts unchanged.\nCC Wei said the company would “continue to closely monitor the potential impact to the market demand” but said the business was enjoying “robust demand from our customers”.\nTSMC, which manufactures the world’s most advanced microchips for companies including Apple and Nvidia, revealed profits surged 60.3pc in the first three months of the year to NT$361.56 billion (£8.4bn), which was better than analyst predictions.\nThe company has been in the cross-hairs of Trump, who has accused Taiwan of stealing the US chip industry, imposing a 32pc “reciprocal” tariff on the country before suspending the levy for 90 days.\nHowever, the US

Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of the 30 stocks in the blue-chip Dow, one of the most commonly cited measures of U.S. stock market performance, closed higher Thursday. TheS&P 500was up 0.13% at the same time and theNasdaq Composite—usually much more volatile than the Dow due to its preponderance of growth stocks—was marginally lower afteryesterday's sell-off.\nThe Dow's dramatic underperformance on Thursday was a clear reflection of the index's unique methodology. The Dow isprice-weighted, meaning the stocks with the highest share prices have the most influence on the index's performance. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, on the other hand, arecapitalization-weighted indexesthat are more influenced by the companies with the highest market values, not the highest share prices.\nUnitedHealth Group, with a closing price of $585.04 yesterday, was the highest-priced stock in the Dow and thus its most influential component. Goldman Sachs (GS), which closed at $499.05 yesterday, is the only Dow stock with a share price within $100 of UnitedHealth's. (With UnitedHealth’s losses on Thursday, Goldman could finish the week as the Dow's heftiest stock.)\nApple (AAPL), with a closing price of $194.27 yesterday, has a fraction of UnitedHealth's influence within the Dow. But the iPhone maker has 15 billion shares, and thus a market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion. UnitedHealth’s approximately 900 million shares put its market cap at Wednesday's close at $535 billion, meaning Apple stock has more than 5 times the weight in the S&P 500.\nTo be sure, UnitedHealth, the S&P 500's 14th-largest company heading into Thursday—still has a massive amount of influence within the S&P 500.\nThe selection committee that picks stocks for the Dow is cognizant of its peculiarities. Its price-weighted methodology, according to S&P Global, \"has meant, over the years, that extremely high-priced stocks have not been included in The Dow.\" Investors often speculate that companies with high share pricessplit their stockin part to increase their chances of joining the Dow. In recent years,Amazon(AMZN) andNvidia(NVDA) have both been added to the Dow in relatively short order aftersplittingtheirstocks, which had been trading at more than $1,000 per share.\nThe Dow isn't the only index susceptible to hazardous imbalance. Earlier this year, theMagnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—accounted for about one-third of the S&P 500, an extreme level of concentration thatset off some investors' alarm bells.\nUpdate, April 17, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect stock and index changes at the market's close.\nRead the original article onInvestopedia",

Analysts led by Amit Daryanani pointed to Apple's diversified production footprint as a key buffer against targeted tariffs.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with UNH.\nAlthough Apple still relies heavily on China for manufacturing, the analysts noted that the company has steadily expanded production into India and Vietnam. According to Evercore's estimates, roughly 35% of U.S. iPhone and iPad demand could now be supported from India, with the rest still met by Chinese facilities. For wearables and Macs, about half the volume could come from Vietnam.\nApple has thus far secured exemptions from China's 100%+ reciprocal tariffs, but the U.S. government's Section 232 probe could extend to electronics. If broader tariffs are implemented, Evercore believes Apple would raise prices and work with suppliers to share added costs.\nThe team emphasized that domestic iPhone production remains unlikely. Higher labor costs in the U.S. could push manufacturing expenses up by more than 50%, making such a move financially impracticaleven in the event of a 50% global tariff baseline.\nDespite uncertainty, Evercore sees Apple's scale and flexibility as long-term advantages.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

The S&P 500 Index gained as much as 0.6%.\nIt would make for a strikingly rare divergence, if it lasts through the trading day. The only day ever when the 30-member Dow closed 1% lower or more while the S&P 500 gained at least 0.5% was in 1954, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n“Though the major indexes generally move together, today’s move is that rare occasion when a high-priced stock in the Dow Industrials makes an outsized move that creates a divergence,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.\nA key difference between the Dow and the broader S&P 500 is the methods used to weight their constituent stocks. The Dow is price-weighted, meaning that changes in the highest-priced stocks have greater impact on the index level than price changes in the lower-priced stocks. The S&P 500, however, is market-cap-weighted.\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group, the top-weighted stock on the Dow, tumbled the most since 1999 after reporting a first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The company also lowered its earnings outlook for the year. The guidance cut is rare for UnitedHealth, which typically forecasts conservatively and often raises its outlook as the year progresses.\nIt would be quite the turnaround for the Dow, which has weathered this year’s market turmoil better than its two broader counterparts.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)has endured a difficult time on the stock market in 2025 as investors have worried about implications of the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from one of its main manufacturing hubs, China, as well as the reciprocal tariffs on other trade partners where the tech giant manufactures its devices.\nShares of the iPhone maker have pulled back 20% this year as of this writing. However, a recent development suggests that Apple may find some reprieve as imports of smartphones, computers, and other electronic items such as processors and displays have been exempted from the reciprocaltariffsimposed on China.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nDoes this mean it is time to capitalize on Apple's dip and buy shares of this tech giant? Let's find out.\nThe Trump administration initially announced reciprocal tariffs of 125% in addition to the existing 20% duties on imports from China. This would have made iPhones and other consumer electronics items that the company manufactures in China way dearer, which explains whyApple stock dropped when the tariffs were announced.\nSo the pause on smartphones and other electronic items from China should come as a relief for Apple, which scrambled to ship an estimated 1.5 million iPhones from India to the U.S. last month to beat the tariff deadline. It is worth noting that the U.S. imposed a 26% tariff rate on imports from India, but they have been paused for 90 days.\nThe bottom line is that Apple seems to be relatively safe from the tariff-related tensions, at least for now. The company would have otherwise faced an adverse impact of $7 billion to $8 billion on iPhone sales, as perMorgan Stanley, even if it managed to shift the majority of its production to India, which was initially in a much lower tariff slab as compared to China.\nThat's because around 80% of Apple's production capacity reportedly lies in China, according to Evercore ISI. That's way higher than India, where Apple reportedly assembles around 10% to 15% of its iPhones. Meanwhile, countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand are Apple's other production hubs, where it produces iPads, wearable devices, and MacBooks. All these countries were initially in the net of reciprocal tariffs before the pause went into effect.\nThe company's mass production facilities in the U.S. are almost negligible, which explains why Apple stock has been under pressure. Import duties would have increased the prices of Apple's products, and it would have had to pass on the higher costs to customers by increasing prices. Such a scenario was likely to negatively impact Apple's iPhone sales, which were already under pressure last year.\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by almost 1% in 2024 to 232 million units. The company has been late in offering artificial intelligence (AI) features to its smartphone customers when compared to rivals such as Samsung and Chinese smartphone manufacturers. A tariff-fueled increase in prices would have hampered sales of iPhones and other products at a time when the company's gradual roll-out of AI features had started having a positive impact on sales.\nAdditionally, Apple would have faced margin challenges if it had been unable to pass on the increased costs to customers. This explains why analysts have reduced their earnings expectations from Apple for the current fiscal year.\nWe have already seen that Apple ramped up its production in India and brought iPhones into the U.S. to beat the tariffs before the administration announced the pause. So, it could start bolstering its manufacturing capacity in countries that are likely to witness lower tariff rates.\nAdditionally, Apple has outlined a massive $500 billion investment plan to shore up its manufacturing operations in the U.S. over the next four years. However, that's not going to happen immediately, as bringing complex supply chains into the U.S. will take time. All this means that Apple will remain exposed to the tariff turmoil until there is a concrete resolution.\nNow, it remains to be seen how this tariff saga unfolds going forward, especially considering recent developments which suggest that the administration is willing to be flexible. The uncertainty around Apple's financial performance seems here to stay. However, if the company manages to deliver better-than-expected numbers or if the end result of the tariff war turns out in its favor, it may be able to regain its mojo.\nConsensus estimates are projecting a 7% increase in Apple's earnings this fiscal year, followed by an estimated jump of 11% in the next one. The stock is currently trading at 31 times earnings, a premium to the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index's earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\nSo, investors would do well to stay on the sidelines for now as a mix of tepid earnings growth, the tariff turmoil, and a slightly richer valuation could keep weighing on the stock. However, it may be a good idea to keep an eye on Apple as it may become worth buying if it becomes cheaper and there are favorable developments on the tariff front since the proliferation of AI could turn out to be a big catalyst for the company in the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now.\nAccording to Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank R Street Institute, Trump’s tariffs could prove to be a massive gift for China, even helping it catch up in the AI race.\n“It’s going to be very hard for the U.S. to win the so-called AI Cold War if America’s trade policies are simultaneously tanking global markets, discouraging technological investments, and potentially undermining traditional alliances with key allies.”\nTrump’s policies are disrupting supply chains and causing volatility in global markets, which may lead US allies to turn to China to meet their technological needs.\n“Suddenly, in the wake of this trade fiasco, we see EU officials saying, ‘Let’s get on the phone with China and talk. Huawei has this telecommunications hardware system they want to sell, and there’s also these AI models that are free of charge.”\nREAD ALSO:10 AI Stocks on the Moveand10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid Market Volatility.\nWith all the tensions caused by the US tariffs, China’s President Xi Jinping has recently called for stronger ties with Vietnam on trade and supply chains as he attended the signing of dozens of cooperation agreements between the two nations. While Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, Vietnam has been negotiating a reduction of U.S. tariffs of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires,Reutersreported.\n“The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,” Xi\nThe President has also urged increased trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.\nDiscussing the meetings, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the two countries’ discussions were focused on harming the United States. However, he said that he did not blame them for holding such talks.\n“I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam. That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, ‘how do we screw the United States of America?'”\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On April 15, Evercore ISI reiterated the stock as “Outperform,” with a price target of $250. The firm stated that it’s standing by the stock in the face of Apple tariff headwinds.\n“Apple looks positioned to deliver upside to Mar-qtr but focus will be on Jun-qtr guide and how they incorporate the impact of tariffs. There are a lot of moving parts on the tariff calculations, but currently imports from China are subject to a 20% tariff – though there is concern that we get a sector tariff that impacts electronics imported from China over the next few months.”\nThe analyst, Amit Daryanani, noted how Apple has been transporting iPhones using multiple Boeing 747 aircraft, demonstrating its major logistical undertaking for inventory management amid tariff tensions. Regardless, the firm remains confident in its rating and price target.\nOverall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of AI stocks you shouldn’t overlook right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nCompanies generate revenue by selling something. The soundest businesses pay off their bills, invest in capital projects, and end up withfree cash flow(FCF).\nOne way to use this FCF is for management teams to repurchase shares of stock. This is generally viewed as a value-accretive endeavor as fewer shares means shareholders own a bigger piece of the pie. So investors might want to pay attention to companies engaging in this activity.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nThere's one tech titan that has long been a leader when it comes to share buybacks,repurchasing a jaw-dropping $695 billion of stockin the past decade. Here's what this means for investors in the company:Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\nAt a market cap of $3.1 trillion,Appleis the world's most valuable enterprise. The business has been wildly successful.\nApple sells some of the most in-demand hardware products. The company says there are nearly 2.4 billion active Apple devices in use around the globe, none more important than the iPhone. This single product represented 56% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, the quarter ended Dec. 18, 2024.\nThe business is also finding tremendous success with its services division. The segment grew sales 14% in the latest fiscal quarter. The digital offerings are great for the company as they carry a stellar 75% gross margin.\nAll this supports the fact that Apple is a money-making machine. In fiscal 2024, it reported $391 billion in total revenue. It notched  $109 billion of that as FCF. This is money that was left over after the leadership team invested in growth initiatives. It's available to be spent on acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks.\nBuybacks are the focal point at Apple, whose dividend yields under 1%. In the last quarter, the company spent $24 billion on repurchases, continuing a long-running trend. In the past 12 months, Apple's diluted outstanding share count has been reduced by almost 3%.\nAt a high level, Apple's sizable stock buybacks showcase just how financially strong this business is. From a numbers perspective, existing shareholders end up owning a larger chunk of the company; fewer shares can raise earnings per share (EPS). Buybacks can also instill confidence among the investment community. Perhaps the buybacks have contributed to Apple stock's impressive 600% total return since April 2015.\nHowever, this doesn't automatically mean Apple shares present a smart buying opportunity today. Ideally, investors want management teams to engage in share buybacks when the stock is cheap, as it indicates sound capital allocation skills to direct excess cash to its best use. Executives should have a firm grasp on the true intrinsic value of their company and can buy back shares below this estimate to benefit all investors.\nIn Apple's case, this is hardly true. In the past 12 months, the stock traded at an averageprice-to-earnings ratioof 34.8. For a company whose EPS declined in fiscal 2024, this valuation looks stretched.\nBut CEO Tim Cook and his team don't have much choice. Apple's best option would be to reinvest more capital directly into the business, maybe to come up with growth avenues like new product or service launches. Instead of repurchasing shares, money would be used to strengthen Apple's competitive position, with the potential to increase revenue and profit years down the line.\nThe issue, though, is that Apple faces limited opportunities to do just this. It's already so ubiquitous and massive that it's extremely difficult to move the needle. The company was reportedly working on an electric vehicle, but plans were scratched. If this had worked out, it would have given Apple a huge end market to enter.\nBut as things stand today, it appears that share buybacks will remain a top priority for Apple. This is the case even with the stock's valuation stretched.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWarren Buffett has made no secret about how much he likesApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), once referring to it as the best business he knows of.It's routinely the top holding in the portfolio ofBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett's conglomerate.\nBut for multiple quarters last year, Berkshire had been trimming its position in the iPhone maker, leading some investors to wonder if the billionaire investor is no longer as optimistic about the tech company.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue »\nNot only do I think that's not true, here's why I also believe he probably added to his position amid the market's recent sell-off.\nIn November 2024, investors noticed that he reduced his stake in the tech company for a fourth consecutive quarter. At that point, he hadsold more than 615 million sharesover the past year. While his reasons are usually not known for why he buys or sells a stock each time, one possible reason could be to do with taxes.\nIn the past, he has voiced concern that the tax rate on capital gains might rise. And presidential candidate Kamala Harris did suggest increasing it.\nBuffett, in looking out for Berkshire shareholders, may have wanted to sell off a big chunk of Apple stock before that happened, to avoid a hefty tax bill for the company given the shares' mammoth rise in value over the years. And rather that spooking the markets with one large stock sale, spreading it out over multiple quarters might have made more sense.\nBut whether it's to do with taxes or Apple's rising valuation, there would have been no reason to believe that he thought the business was in trouble. It consistently generates more than $90 billion in profit each year, and its revenue over the trailing 12 months has totaled nearly $400 billion. Its services business continues to grow, and although investors today may be worried abouttariffs, at the time of the stock sales there would have been no glaring reason for worry.\nDuring the current quarter, which began in April, I would expect to see a big purchase from Berkshire, adding to its position in Apple. Under President Donald Trump, capital gains taxes might not increase, and it's possible he could even decrease them.\nEither way, the risk is considerably much lower under the current administration, which may alleviate any concerns Buffett had about a rising tax rate, at least for the foreseeable future.\nWhat is notable is that he stopped selling Apple stock in the fourth quarter of 2024 -- when the election took place and the risk of Harris raising capital gains taxes was gone. It may have just been a coincidence, but it's hard to ignore the timing.\nAnother incentive to buy the stock is Apple's crash after Trump's declaration of \"Liberation Day\" and the announcement of global tariffs. That caused investors to dump their shares on fears that tariffs would significantly raise costs for the tech company.\nThe stock would end up falling, and on April 8 it closed at $172.42 -- not far from its 52-week low of $164.08. For Buffett, that may have created a buying opportunity too appealing to pass up. And I believe with the tax fears alleviated and Berkshire's position in Apple being significantly reduced, it would have made it easy to justify adding to its stake in the consumer tech company at some point this month.\nWhile the tariff risk is still there, for a long-term investor such as Buffett, I don't believe it would have necessarily dissuaded him from buying the stock.\nIf you're a long-term investor, you'll want to consider buying and holding Apple for not just years but decades. Tariffs could cause problems for its operations in the short run but if you're investing for the long haul, it may not matter all that much in the end.\nThe company's fundamentals remain strong, and with an excellent brand behind it, Apple is one of the safest and best growth stocks you can hold in your portfolio today.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg, the first witness in the Federal Trade Commission’s trial to break up his social media empire, gave a rare window into how he makes business decisions: by fighting for survival, even when his company is ahead.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Signs Executive Orders on Federal Purchasing, Office Space\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\nDOGE Places Entire Staff of Federal Homelessness Agency on Leave\nWhy the Best Bike Lanes Always Get Blamed\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\nOver a marathon three days of testimony, the Meta Platforms Inc. co-founder and chief executive officer clearly articulated how the social media market has evolved rapidly over time — which, if the judge agrees, could make it more difficult for the FTC to prove Meta dominates it.\nZuckerberg was composed, but occasionally evasive, when challenged to explain past emails and other private messages indicating a concerted effort to muscle out competitors.\nThose old messages and emails, gathered during the pre-trial discovery process, were more damning than his present-day testimony. The messages, often between Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives, painted a picture of an executive who was paranoid about his rivals and willing to buy competitors whenever possible.\nThe FTC is seeking to force Meta to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the two acquisitions have given Meta an illegal monopoly over parts of the social networking industry. Emails and documents presented at trial show that Meta, then called Facebook Inc., struggled to compete in the mobile app boom in the early 2010s, buying up successful competitors. The FTC said Meta bought the companies to eliminate direct competitive threats.\nMultiple Competitors\nZuckerberg and Meta’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Meta faces a wide array of competitors that fight for user attention, including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube, Apple Inc.’s iMessage and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that TikTok, in particular, posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat when it sprang up in 2018.\n“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, Zuckerberg said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.” Meta eventually rolled out a direct competitor, called Reels, that now drives a significant amount of video traffic for the company.\nZuckerberg was at times vague over his three days in court, and regularly disputed the FTC’s interpretations of his prior emails. As a leader, the way he communicated with staff was often blunt or harsh, and he spent time on the stand trying to add more nuance to what was written by his younger self. He occasionally clashed with the FTC’s lead lawyer, Daniel Matheson, who objected at one point that Zuckerberg wasn’t answering his questions.\nWhat’s unclear is how much weight those emails will ultimately have as US District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case, makes his decision. Meta has argued that the intent behind the purchases doesn’t matter, only whether those deals lead to consumer harm, which it disputes.\nBoasberg previously said the FTC will have a difficult time. Despite allowing the bulk of the case to proceed last November, Boasberg struck a skeptical tone about the FTC’s chances at trial. “Prevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the Commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial,” the judge said. “Indeed, its positions at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.”\nBoasberg also said in a ruling shortly before the trial that the FTC must prove Meta is harming competition in the present day.\nSheryl Sandberg, the company’s former chief operating officer, followed Zuckerberg on the witness stand, facing sharp questioning from FTC lawyer Susan Musser.\nIf the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta’s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals because the government allowed the transactions to go through at the time.\n‘Network Effects’\nPart of the FTC’s case involves the technical concept of “network effects,” meaning that the more users a company like Meta has, the more likely they are to retain a dominant position, because people are unlikely to switch to a service used by few people.\nBoasberg has remained largely silent during the questioning, but interjected during Zuckerberg’s testimony Wednesday to ask if network effects still really matter.\n“How much does it matter if your friends are on a particular platform if you can send content out of that platform? Why does it matter if your friends are there?” the judge said.\nZuckerberg said it doesn’t. “These apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” he said. “People can take that content to messaging engines.”\nBigger Company\nUnder questioning by Meta lawyer, Mark Hansen, Zuckerberg refuted the FTC’s argument that Meta bought Instagram to bury a competitor. Instagram would not likely have been able to grow to the extent it has had it remained independent, he said. “Instagram has been built out into a much more vibrant service” as a result of the deal, Zuckerberg said.\nTaking a small online platform to a billion users and beyond is unlikely to happen without the backing of a larger company, he said. “Every company that has this level of scale is owned by a bigger company,” he said, citing TikTok and YouTube as examples.\nEarlier in the trial, it was revealed that Snap Inc.’s Evan Spiegel turned down a $6 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013 for its Snapchat app. Zuckerberg said that the app would have grown more rapidly had it joined his company.\nZuckerberg sought to walk back some statements that he made in previous internal communications. He acknowledged that he sent a 2013 email saying that Facebook blocked advertising for messaging apps WeChat, Kakao and Line, in which he wrote the apps were “trying to build social networks to replace us.” On the stand this week, however, he said “it’s hard for me to characterize what their intent was.”\nMatheson also sought to show that Meta was aware of its antitrust risk years ago, including a possible breakup.\nHe displayed an email from 2018 in which Zuckerberg suggested that Meta should consider spinning off Instagram into a standalone company. “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway,” he wrote.\nAt one point, Zuckerberg was asked by Hansen to describe how he was evaluating the competitive threat posed by Instagram and others at the time of the deals. He referenced a quote from former Intel Corp. CEO Andy Grove: “Only the paranoid survive.”\n(Updates with color on Zuckerberg testimony starting in the first paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nThe US stock market is showing volatility after President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of sweeping 10% tariffs on all US trading partners and higher tariffs on countries with a trade deficit with the US.\nEconomists and investors believe President Trump’s tariff policies could potentially lead to a trade war with America’s trading partners, propelling inflation even higher. These two factors could plunge the US into an economic slowdown, and the markets could potentially sell off quickly if a recession materializes among its looming threats.\nOn April 10, CNBC reported that stock prices rose sharply a day before after declining for four days straight following President Trump’s announcement of a pause in a significant part of his tariff plan. The White House said that Democratic lawmakers were indulged in partisan games by inquiring if any stock market purchases conducted in recent days were undertaken with prior knowledge of the fact that President Trump would authorize a pause in his tariff plans. Trump announced higher tariffs on China even after he announced a 90-day pause for steeper-than-baseline rates for several other countries.\nREAD ALSO:10 Best Medical Stocks to Buy According to Billionairesand10 Best Organic Food Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\nOn April 11, Erica York, economist and the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy, talked to CNBC’s “The Exchange” about the ongoing scenario and said that the imposition of around 145% total tariff on Chinese goods would result in a suspension of most trade between the US and China. She said:\n“It depends on how narrowly the tariff is applied or how broadly it’s applied, but generally, if you get north of a triple-digit tariff, you are cutting off most trade.”\nShe further opined that:\n“There may still be some things without any substitutes that companies just have to foot the bill, but for the most part, that cuts it off.”\nThe economist said that Trump’s new China tariffs, along with the others he implemented, would raise the average tariff rate to record highs the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s. The current market volatility has created numerous remarkable investment opportunities, so let’s look at the 15 best blue chip stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nWe reviewed financial media reports and ETFs to compile an initial list of blue chip stocks and selected stocks that have a 5-year revenue growth rate of at least 10%.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and related products and services worldwide. The company’s stock is facing turbulence and skepticism after Trump imposed 125% tariffs on China, which is where much of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products come from.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring released a note on April 10, speculating that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could experience a $7 billion to $8 billion drop on next year’s iPhone sales even if the company manages to reroute around 60% of its production to India. The analyst maintained an overweight rating on the stock and set a one-year price target of $220 per share, based on the expectations that it would route around 50% of the tariff costs to suppliers, lowering the effect on its EPS.\nApart from these circumstances, Apple Inc.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nBy Jamie McGeever\nORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - TRADING DAY\nMaking sense of the forces driving global markets\nBy Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist\nTariffied once again\nThe respite was too good to last, and sure enough, it didn't. World stocks fell into a downward spiral on Wednesday led by tech losses after Washington said it is putting new curbs on AI chip exports to China, marking an escalation in the global trade war.\nThe Trump administration's latest broadside sparked huge demand for safe-haven assets like gold, the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasuries, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled he is in no rush to cut interest rates.\nIf U.S. Big Tech had acquired a safe-haven status in the eyes of some investors in recent years, it is disappearing fast. More on that and more below, but first, a round-up of the day's main market moves. I'd love to hear from you, so please reach out to me with comments at . You can also follow me at @ReutersJamie and @reutersjamie.bsky.social.\nIf you have more time to read today, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets.\n1.

EXCLUSIVE-Nvidia kept some China customers in the darkabout new US chip clampdown, sources say 5.

Will the damage done to Nvidia and others on Wednesday prompt a similar rethink?\nEconomic signals from China and the U.S. on Wednesday were surprisingly positive, with U.S. retail sales in March and first quarter Chinese GDP growth beating forecasts. But these are rear-view mirror indicators, and if anyone needed it, Wednesday's news is a reminder that the outlook is pretty bleak.\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley and UBS this week cut their Chinese 2025 GDP outlooks to 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively. Anything close to the UBS forecast would be particularly alarming for Beijing, which is targeting growth of around 5%.\nMorgan Stanley's economists estimate tariffs will knock 90 basis points off growth relative to their original forecast, which will only be partially offset by 60 bps of additional stimulus.\nAlthough U.S. growth is slowing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Wednesday the central bank will wait for \"greater clarity\" before deciding its next move on rates. He also said markets have been orderly and downplayed the risk of Fed intervention.\nMassive selling of long-dated Treasuries last week raised fears that part of the bond market wasn't functioning smoothly. There was no sign of that on Wednesday, however, as bonds' 'safe haven' qualities pushed yields down as much as 5 basis points at the short end.\nIn Europe, eyes will turn to Frankfurt where the European Central Bank on Thursday will announce its latest policy decision and ECB President Christine Lagarde will offer her outlook. Market pricing suggests a 25 basis point cut is all but certain, with at least another two coming later this year.\nAnd after Wednesday's rout, the focus in Asia on Thursday will stay on tech as Taiwan's TSMC reports first-quarter earnings. The world's largest contract chipmaker is expected to report a 34.2% increase in revenue to $25.318 billion from $18.87 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from five analysts based on LSEG data.\nTech and tariffs - a potent mix which roiled markets on Wednesday and will likely do so again sooner rather than later.\nUS Big Tech swaps 'safe haven' sheen for trade war target\nTreasuries are not the only 'safe haven' U.S. asset getting the cold shoulder as investors around the world rethink their enthusiasm for all things America. The shadow over 'Big Tech' is darkening and lengthening too.\nIn recent weeks, the global trade war, the Trump administration's 'America First' agenda and its apparent disdain for the post-war world order have dramatically slowed inflows into U.S. markets, and in some cases, reversed them. What used to be considered some of the safest shelters from crisis are now looking a little flimsy.\nIt might seem a stretch to put shares of U.S. technology and chip companies, such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, on par with IOUs of the federal government, but these cash-generating emblems of 'U.S. exceptionalism' certainly seemed like sure things up until recently.\nAs these firms' global dominance spread over the past decade and their market footprint reached an unprecedented size, they effectively become ATMs for shareholders, generating record profits running into the hundreds of billions of dollars.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, the 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla - accounted for a record 35% of the S&P 500's market cap, with a combined valuation of around $17.5 trillion. Credit ratings on some, like Apple, are the same as the U.S. sovereign rating, and yields have even traded below Treasury yields on occasion.\nInvestors of all stripes wanted in, from domestic to foreign, retail to official.\nAnd who could blame them? The 'Mag 7' appeared to offer the best of both investment worlds: a high income-generating asset and a safe-haven. So much so that the Swiss National Bank has a quarter of its $150 billion equity holdings in Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, and half of the $1.8 trillion Norwegian wealth fund's record $222 billion profit last year came from U.S. tech.\nREALITY CHECK\nBut that sweet spot is gone. The 'American exceptionalism' narrative has been undermined, as the U.S. economy looks set to slow and America's AI invincibility has been shattered by China's DeepSeek. And now tech companies find themselves on the front line of the global trade war.\nWashington is issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. Nvidia said it faces $5.5 billion in charges, and its shares tumbled 9% on Wednesday, wiping nearly $250 billion off its market value and dragging the broader semiconductor index down 4%.\nTo be sure, U.S. tech has been getting slammed since mid-February, as investors have begun to re-evaluate the sunny outlook they had for the industry under a Trump presidency. The semiconductor index is now deep in a bear market. It has lost 30% in just two months and valuations have come down much more than the wider S&P 500.\nU.S. Big Tech is suddenly vulnerable on multiple fronts. Tariffs and trade restrictions from Washington will bite, as will retaliatory moves from China. And if Europe really wants to hit America where it hurts, tech is an obvious target.\nWHAT GOES UP...\nBut it's also worth remembering how much Big Tech outperformed on the way up. They were - and remain - incredibly profitable. According to LSEG figures, the Mag 7's net profit margin hit a record 25.8% in the fourth quarter, nearly double the S&P 500's 13.4%.\nNvidia's value rose 10-fold in two years to more than $3.5 trillion, Mag 7 stocks more than doubled between October 2023 and last December, and these companies accounted for almost all of the market's profit growth in 2023.\nWhile that halved last year and is expected to decline further this year to around a third, there is still a lot of air left to come out of the balloon. According to Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey, 'long Mag 7' was the most crowded trade for 23 consecutive months until April.\nAnd what was it replaced with? Long gold, one 'safe haven' that isn't giving up its title.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* TSMC earnings (Q1) * Japan trade (March) * Bank of Korea interest rate decision * European Central Bank interest rate decision * Germany producer price inflation (March) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. 5-year TIPs auction * U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meets Japan EconomyMinister Ryosei Akazawa\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThose shopping for a new smartphone or computer may be spared from tariff-induced sticker shock. At least, for now.\nPresident Donald Trumpissued a memorandumon April 11 saying certain electronics — including computers, smartphones and some components — won’t be subject to the reciprocal tariffs imposed on imports from China. While tariffs on virtually all other products from China are now at least 145%, prices of smartphones and certain other devices should avoid completely skyrocketing, at least for a little while.\nBut with comments from the Trump administration indicating an upcoming wave of tariffs on semiconductors — a critical part of the chips that power electronic devices — it’s still unclear if and when tech products could get more expensive in the US. Plus, the current exclusions aren’t expected to cover many everyday tech products that consumers are likely to buy more frequently than new phones — such as some charging cables and earbuds.\nThat makes it challenging for shoppers to know what to expect, but also for tech companies to adjust their supply chains and shipments as demand potentially fluctuates due to tariff-induced price swings — all while keeping prices reasonable.\n“It’s completely impossible for any company to plan,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of client devices for the International Data Corporation, a firm that tracks global shipments of tech devices. “So the best, the only thing they can do at the moment is… ship as many products as they can while the exemption lasts to the US.”\nSome reports indicate that companies may be doing just that. Apple’s India-based suppliers shipped a record number of iPhones to the US in March, nearly $2 billion worth, according toReuters. PC shipments grew by 12.6% in the US during the first quarter of 2025 as vendors increased shipments ahead of potential tariffs, market research firm Gartner said in a press release Monday.\nThe exception is a major win for Apple, which relies on iPhone sales for most of its revenue — about $69 billion of its roughly $124 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2025 — and has much of its smartphone supply chain located in China. But the Trump administration has indicated that more tech tariffs are coming.\nTrump wrote in aTruth Social poston Sunday that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” when it comes to tariffs, adding that “there was no tariff exception” announced and these products are still subject to a 20% tariff on Chinese imports.\nThe excepted products will be moved to a “different tariff bucket” as the administration examines the “whole electronics supply chain,” the post said. The Trump administration on Monday beganinvestigating semiconductor importsto set the stage for tariffs.\nKevin Hassett, national economic council director, said when speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that “it was always the case” that semiconductors would be covered under a separate action rather than reciprocal tariffs.\nThe exception came after Trump’s tariff policies resulted in a whirlwind couple of weeks forthe stock market, with the S&P 500 having its worst week since 2020 earlier this month.\nBut thestock market saw massive gainslast week when Trump announceda 90-day pauseon most reciprocal tariffs, a sign that investors were seeking a reprieve from his levies.\nThe exclusions specifically mention smartphones, computers (described as “automatic data processing machines”), monitors, storage devices and various components that power those devices, including integrated circuits and transistors.\nBut a host of other tech products don’t appear to be included in the exceptions, such as USB charging cables, portable battery packs, headphones and video game consoles, a public affairs officer for the US International Trade Commission said in response to a CNN inquiry about whether these products fall under the exceptions.\nBut it’ll likely depend on which components are inside these devices and how they’re categorized.\nThe US ITC also said computer mice and keyboards are covered under the exceptions, but added that US Customs and Border Protection has the final say on how imported goods are classified and whether they’re exempted from tariffs.\n“It’s a gray area,” said Dave Marcotte, a senior vice president and analyst with market research and consultancy firm Kantar. “This is where you get creative about describing your products when you move to Customs. If you look at the scheduling and say, ‘Okay, well, I have, I have peripherals. Are peripherals covered? Or (are) computer cables covered?’ Well, they’re the same thing.”\nEven before Trump specified these exclusions, some analysts had expected smaller items like charging cables and headphones to be among those most heavily impacted by tariffs.\n“I think the first things you’re going to see (are) the stuff we don’t really pay attention to, like… USB chargers and batteries and stuff that’s less than, say, $20, $25,” Marcotte said last week ahead of Trump’s exception on smartphones and other select tech products. “It’s going to be the small stuff.”\nSmaller companies don’t have the supply chain flexibility of a stalwart like Apple, for example, and the margins on cheaper items such as charging cables are much lower. That means these firms don’t have as much flexibility to absorb additional tariff costs and would likely have to pass it down to consumers to turn a profit.\nAnd many of these ancillary tech gadgets appear to be from China.\nWhen CNN searched Amazon for earbuds under $50, iPhone charging cables and portable battery packs, many of the top five results for each product either had China listed as the country of origin, or mentioned a manufacturer based in China. Some of the results didn’t name a country of origin, but other product pages from the same sellers listed products as coming from China.\nTrump also got rid of the “de minimis exemption,” which allowed packages valued at less than $800 to enter the US tax-free — another change that’s expected to impact the prices cheap goods from China.\nPrice hikes on these smaller, cheaper items could feel more impactful to consumers in some cases since the difference in price may feel more drastic.\n“A $40 increase to an $80 increase looks a lot worse for a consumer than, say, a $1,200 to $1,500,” said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys.\nAlthough some tech products got a break on certain reciprocal levies, new tariffs on semiconductors are expected to arrive in the “next month or two,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick toldABC Newson Sunday. It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to reduce US reliance on China while reshoring manufacturing.\nBut tariffs or not, the chances of an American-made iPhone seem slim. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, but higher labor costs and the logistics of shifting Apple’s massive production network to the other side of the world — further away from Asia, where many components would likely still be sourced — present major challenges.\nAnd it’s not just the components. Finding workers would be an issue, too.\n“It’s very hard to find skilled labor in the numbers they need,” Jeronimo said.\nApple in February announceda $500 billion investmentto expand its US operations. But that commitment is largely focused on building production facilities for Apple Intelligence servers and boosting education in manufacturing, not building iPhones. And while several tech leaders like chipmaking giants TSMC and Nvidia have announced major US expansions, the tech supply chain is largely expected to remain in China, says Jeronimo.\nCompanies are more likely to shift some production to other regions, like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to Jeronimo.\nTrump’s tariff policy is already seems to be impacting some tech product launches and shipments. The US smartphone market grew more than 5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the IDC, partially driven by a “sense of urgency to buy before potential price increases,” the IDC’s research director for client devices Anthony Scarsella said in a Monday press release.\nNintendo also postponed US preorders for its newSwitch 2 gameconsole in early April as it assesses the tariff situation.\n“You stockpile during a hurricane because it happens for five days,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester. “There is no pantry in the world that’s large enough where you can stockpile four years’ worth of trade policy uncertainty.”\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWe recently published a list of13 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2025.\nOn April 4, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives appeared on CNBC to discuss the potential impact of current tariffs and compared the situation to an economic armageddon. If the current tariffs remain in place, Ives thinks it would lead to a 15% to 20% demand reduction across the board. He thinks that investor anxiety is much higher considering how things were in the March 2020 COVID-19 crash earlier. The analyst thinks that investors should now focus on the likelihood of tariff adjustments from comments about negotiations, the impact on consumer-focused companies, and the potential for demand destruction. He even thinks that companies may refuse to provide guidance in the first-quarter earnings calls due to the persistent tariff uncertainty.\nIves thinks that a lot of tech companies will not be able to absorb high tariff increases and rather this cost will be passed on to the consumers which will lead to significant margin erosion and even potential sales declines. He indicated that tech stocks are currently pricing in a 10% to 15% cut to numbers. He suggests that investors should now look at companies with strong long-term potential as he believes earnings may normalize in 2025 and 2026. The analyst also addressed the defensive performance of defense contractors. While acknowledging the relative stability here, Ives cautioned that even these even such sectors are not immune to tariffs. He noted the significant foreign component, specifically 40% to 50% in some instances, in hardware and other sectors.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through the financial media reports to compile a list of the top NASDAQ stocks to buy for 2025. We then selected the 13 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs and manufactures smart devices. It offers smartphones under the iPhone line, personal computers under the Mac line, and multi-purpose tablets, under the iPad line. It also offers other accessories and wearables, like the AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, and HomePod. It also offers AppleCare support and cloud services.\nErik Woodring from Morgan Stanley lowered his iPhone shipment estimates for 2025-2026 by 1% to 5% because of delayed releases at the company. This is because of quality issues and malfunction rates that exceed 80%. Since June 2024, many features planned for release in April with iOS 18.4 2025 have been postponed. The company now aims to fix these issues by 2026, but the investors are already concerned about the competitiveness of its AI development.\nWoodring has also reduced his price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $275 to $252 due to the lack of an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle. The company is generally best known for its iPhone product cycle, with 52% of its revenue coming from this product line. The company has over 2.2 billion devices on sale and the next target is now to integrate AI for strengthening these service offerings.\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund is optimistic about the company due to iPhone 17’s AI potential. It stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024investor letter:\n“The fund maintained a position inApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) throughout the quarter through the release of the company’s new iPhone 16 in September. Company leaders were excited about the release of the new model, as this is the first model that will feature enhanced AI capabilities through the Apple Intelligence features. Sales for the first few weeks in October and November trailed behind year over year sales from the iPhone 15, as availability of Apple Intelligence was not compatible with all iPhone models. Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI that has allowed the integration of ChatGPT into the Apple ecosystem, separate from the core Apple Intelligence features. This partnership highlights continued progress from Apple to introduce AI capabilities into its products and we expect the iPhone 17 to have even more expansive AI capabilities, increasing potential demand for the new model that is on track to be released in 2025.”\nOverall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nPresident Trump is determined to bring tech manufacturing to the US via massive tariffs. But there's little chance companies like Apple (AAPL) will reinvent their supply chains before Trump leaves office in 2028.\nThe Trump administration hit China with a whopping 145% tariff on Chinese-made goods before announcing exemptions for tech devices ranging from smartphones to laptops on Friday. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on Sunday that the movewas temporary and only applied to Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\nInstead, he explained, tech products will be tariffed as part of the administration's planned duties on semiconductors, which could be announced later this week.\nStill, even the threat of sky-high tariffs won't be enough to force tech giants like Apple to pick up and move their suppliers to the US en masse.\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\"Anything is possible, but the setup of smartphone production in India has been a three-year process from site identification through ramped-up production, with at least another two years to achieve full supply chain integration,\" Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance.\nIt's not just about timing. Companies would also need the workers to build devices.\n\"While there's a degree of automation possible and while many of the components needed are made in the US, there's still a need for tens of thousands of trained electronics assemblers willing to work long, arduous hours in highly repetitive tasks,\" he added.\nCompanies including Nvidia (NVDA), TSMC (TSM), Apple, and others have announced increased investments in the US to win over Trump and avoid tariffs. On Monday, Nvidia said it will produce $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through partners including Foxconn (601138.SS), TSMC, and Wistron (3231.TW).\nApple also said it will spend $500 billion, and TSMC has said it will spend $165 billion. Many of those plans, however, were already in the works or don't necessarily goabove prior spending levels. Nvidia, for example, talked upbuilding chips in the US last year.\nAnd while that doesn't take away from the fact that the companies are pouring money into the US, it doesn't exactly support the idea that they're moving vast amounts of their manufacturing capabilities to America.\n\"We believe hardware companies will remain focused on accelerating US-bound product assembly out of China, and see India and Mexico as the most-likely incremental beneficiaries of these actions (we'd argue Vietnam and Mexico have been the biggest beneficiaries over the last 5 years),\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\n\"We just don't see large volume hardware production ever reaching US shores — these plans take years to devise, the costs (capex and opex) associated with manufacturing hundreds of millions of products annually in the US are high, and most importantly, tariff exemptions on finished goods disincentivize on-shoring (and is why we didn't see onshoring after President Trump's first administration),\" he added\nEven if companies brought their manufacturing bases to the US, they'd still have to deal with a host of headwinds ranging from worker salaries to the need to continue importing certain parts from abroad.\nAccording to Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan, while Apple may be able to find enough laborers in the US to build its iPhones, importing the company's entire supply chain will still take some time.\n\"This is because, while it may be possible to move final assembly to the US, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible.\"\nIt's not just Apple that's contending with these issues. Everything from laptop makers to display producers would face the same problems if they were to move to the US. That doesn't even take into account the potential price increases associated with manufacturing tech products in the US.\nAccording to some estimates, prices on devices could jump by hundreds of dollars, resulting in demand destruction as consumers seek out less expensive options or hold onto their existing smartphones and computers for longer periods.\nWhile it's unlikely manufacturing is coming back to the US, there's still plenty of uncertainty about how tech companies and consumers navigate the next four years of tariff shocks.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nMadison Millsand Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick examine some of today's trending tickers.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock is falling after the company warned that new US chip rules on exports to China would cost the company $5.5 billion. Analysts at Bank of America, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James lowered their price targets for the chipmaker stock.\nApple's (AAPL) India suppliers shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of US President Trump's tariffs.\nWall Street's top financial firms, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS), saw record-high trading revenue in the first quarter, driven by tariff-fueled market volatility.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\nIt's now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Nvidia, Apple, and Wall Street banks. First up, several Wall Street firms cutting their price targets on Nvidia stock after the chip maker disclosed that it anticipates a $5.5 billion charge from new chip curbs. The US government told Nvidia earlier this month it would need a special license to export certain chips to China. Analysts at BFA Global Research, Piper Sandler, and Raymond James all lowering their price targets on the news. And also, Steve, what I also thought was really interesting here is an analyst over at City talking about how it's not just about Nvidia. This could also impact Broadcom. This could also impact other chip names in the space.\nWell, you're seeing them, you're seeing them sell off today. I mean, you know, AMD announced an $800 million charge along in there. Um, you know, Broadcom was trading lower this morning as well. ASML was trading lower, although they released earnings, but, but they're all, they're all part and parcel of this. This is not good news for the chip sector, because, you know, I, I don't mean to just sound like a broken record, but this is uncertainty, and uncertainty, the markets don't love uncertainty.\nWell, speaking, speaking of uncertainty, let's get to another name we're looking at. Apple's main suppliers in India shipping roughly $2 billion worth of iPhones in March ahead of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement. That is according to new customs data. Smartphones have since secured a temporary reprieve from tariffs, but persistent tensions between the US and China threaten the iPhone maker's China-focused supply chain in the longer term. The Wall Street Journal reporting Apple is investigating moving some iPhone production to the US, but the process could take years, and CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that it would be difficult to find the skilled labor in America that's needed to build the smartphones. Treasury Secretary Scott Beson dismissed that comment and concern in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nYou don't need a PhD in mechanical engineering to assemble an iPhone. So, I, I'm not sure why Tim Cook says that the skills aren't here.\nAnd Steve, I think what analysts who cover Apple might say and investors might say is that that skilled labor does take years to build up, and it's certainly something that allows Apple to turn out these iPhones incredibly quickly.\nWell, that's it. I mean, every, you know, labor now is not just, you know, pounding a hammer or nail. There, there's, there's, there's intricacies in the supply chain. You know, I, I know that, you know, the commerce secretary with his comment, you know, we're going to have lots of people screwing tiny little screws into things. That's not what people really want. You know, we want the high-tech value-added manufacturing because, quite frankly, our cost basis is higher. So, if there's value-added stuff to be done, that's great. If it's just, if it's just bringing low-skilled labor, bringing back low-skilled jobs, that's not necessarily, you know, I understand the need for that, particularly maybe in some strategic industries, but overall, I think we want people bringing a skill set to it. You know, I saw a statistic, this was posted on, on, on Twitter by my friend Frank Luntz who I trust. Um, and he got the statistics from the Cato Institute. 80% of the people when asked, said, do you want more manufacturing in the US? 80% said yes. When asked, would you take a factory job? 75% said no. 23% said yes. The other two said I already have a factory job. So, it, it's, you know, it's one of these, it's nice in theory, but in practice, um, you know, you need skilled, the people who are going to take these jobs, by definition, are really going to be skilled labor. Not, not just, you know, people, not just, you know, automatons screwing in screws.\nYeah. Right. The price that they're requiring for their labor requires it to be skilled. All right. Finally, trading desks at some of the biggest names in banking crashed in, cashed in, rather, on market volatility in the most recent quarter. And that is not including the past two weeks, which fell outside of that reporting period. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman, all seeing record equity trading revenue during the quarter. Despite the blockbuster results, executives did express some caution about the current macro backdrop. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning of considerable turbulence roiling the US economy. Well, Goldman's David Solomon said the prospects of a recession had increased. You couldn't pay Solomon to mention the word tariffs, but he did semi-maybe allude to it in that comment. Is this trading revenue for banks a signal of strength in your view, Steve? Or is this something that can kind of hide any economic macro concerns?\nKind of the latter. You know, I remember I spent the bulk of my career as an option trader, and I used, I loved environments like this. Um, you know, and to Jamie Dimon's comment, you know, about turbulence, you know, I always described VIX as sort of the price of a parachute when the plane hits turbulence at some level. You know, people want that protection. But here's what happens during volatility with, if you're an active trader. You widen your spreads, you shrink your sizes. So, effectively that really impairs liquidity, but if you're the person trading off those bid offs, bid-ask spreads, each trade you do is more profitable. And so, yes, that leads to the trading desks making more money, but really, you know, analysts typically discount that over time. It's actually a little odd this quarter that the analysts are very happy that the banks are making all this money trading because for years, again, as a trader at a publicly traded firm, the analysts were always very dismissive when we had a good quarter.\nYeah. Right, right, because it's potentially not a sign of continued gains for, for the banks. Steve, thank you so much for sticking with us.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:\n“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Hints at a Bigger Agenda Behind Tariffs and Breaks Down These 7 StocksandJim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key Stocks.\nTurning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:\n“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”\nCramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:\n“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 14th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in the context of escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and the existential threat tariffs pose to the company’s supply chain and margin structure. He emphasized how vulnerable Apple is compared to competitors like Samsung, especially when government policies appear to be more favorable to foreign players. Here is what he had to say:\n“Look, I can’t tell what really happened with Apple, other than the fact that if you wanted to take Apple down, you’d keep doing what they were doing. And the reason I say that, very specifically, is because Apple is a loser to Samsung. […]\nA day earlier, Jim Cramer analyzed some of the risks that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces with the current regime. Here’s what he said last time:\n“And I think that one of the things that’s happening is that people are just saying, look, it’s too crazy. I mean, Apple was up. Now, I could argue that Apple shouldn’t have ever been up, but Apple’s come down. There’s a sense that, like, OK, this thing may be for real.

Despite a recent rebound, shares trade ~30% below their 52-week highs, with the decline somewhat justified. Indeed, higher costs and global trade tensions could dent the company’s near-term prospects. Still, the effort to restore chip manufacturing to U.S. soil promises a lucrative payoff in the long run. Given this narrative and AMAT’s unmatched role in chip production, I’m bullish on the stock.\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter withTop Smart Score Stocks.\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities usingTipranks' Stock Screener.\nEven with a90-daytariffpause on semiconductors and electronics announced last Friday, it’s clear that Applied Materials faces choppy waters. The remaining 10% global tariff hike will undoubtedly damage chipmakers like Intel (INTC) and TSMC (TSM), who depend on imported wafers, gases, and components. This will squeeze their budgets, potentially freezing orders for AMAT’s high-end tools.\nTake its $20 million etching systems, for instance, or its deposition chambers, critical for cutting-edge chips. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods further threaten AMAT’s foothold in a market that, for context, accounted for 30% of last year’s $26.5 billion in revenue.\nThe uncertainty is already biting. A single delayed fab can wipe out $500 million in AMAT orders, and with Asian chipmakers like Samsung rethinking expansion amid tariff chaos, you can see why the market might think that AMAT’s multi-billion-dollar backlog risks stalling. And then you have a story about Trump’s looming semiconductor-specific tariffs, which the market expects to hit within months. Undoubtedly, they keep customers jittery, as they are reluctant to greenlight projects when costs could spike overnight. It’s like a waiting game where hesitation makes more sense than action, leaving AMAT to tread carefully through a murky year.\nIf AMAT’s outlook wasn’t already wobbly, the company’s supply chain isn’t immune. Tariffs on niche materials, like high-purity silicon or rare-earth metals, could inflate costs, forcing the company to either absorb the hit or pass it on, risking customer pushback. So, for now, AMAT stock is facing pressure on multiple fronts.\nDespite the potential headwinds I just mentioned, investors should keep their minds open and consider that a bullish case might be hiding in the shadows. If Trump’s dream of a U.S. chipmaking renaissance pans out, maybe, just maybe, Applied Materials could be the golden goose. Tariffs are designed to lure chipmakers to American soil, and AMAT, the king of deposition and etching tools, is primed to cash in.\nNew fabs in places like Ohio or Arizona would devour AMAT’s machines, each plant potentially funneling $1 billion in orders for systems that layer and sculpt chips for AI, EVs, and defense. TheCHIPS Act’s $52 billion war chestalready greases the wheels, and tariffs could kneecap foreign rivals like ASML (ASML), whose scanners might face a looming 20% import tax with further increases on the table.\nBeyond fab construction, AMAT is also poised to ride the wave of state-of-the-art packaging andAIchip demand. Tariffs will likely incentivize U.S. production of complex chipsets, including Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs or Apple’s (AAPL) M-series, requiring AMAT’s advanced 3D stacking and hybrid bonding tools.\nIndustry projections suggest advanced packaging revenue could hit $79 billion by 2034. AMAT’s early lead in this niche could drive billions in orders as domestic firms like Intel scale up to compete globally. If tariffs lock in this shift, AMAT’s role as a tech enabler makes it a leader in America’s chip revival.\nAfter last week’s selloff, Applied Materials’ stock seems compelling, especially assuming the bullish case plays out. Down 30% from its 52-week peak, the stock trades at about 15x forward earnings. Analysts have trimmed their forecasts, yetAMAT is still set to churn out $6 billion in free cash flow this year, which is not too bad compared to last year’s ~$7 billion, considering the circumstances. Its $1.63 billion net cash pile also adds flexibility liquidity-wise, letting AMAT invest while peers might think twice about spending these days.\nOn Wall Street, analysts appear quite bullish on GM stock. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy, four Hold, and one Sell ratings over the past three months.AMAT’s average price target of $203.87implies a 41% upside potential over the next twelve months, aligning with my view that the stock is currently undervalued.\nIn the grand scheme, short-term tariff troubles may be a speed bump for Applied Materials. The industry giant’s critical role in the semiconductor production chain positions it to benefit significantly if U.S. chipmaking takes off. Yes, near-term volatility is real, with delayed fab projects, hesitance to spend, and potential cost hikes weighing on the stock.\nYet these hurdles could also fast-track a domestic manufacturing boom, funneling billions toward AMAT’s advanced tools for AI, 3D packaging, and beyond. For these reasons, I believe that AMAT remains a long-term play worth watching, especially for politically savvy tech-sector investors.\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAs recession fears mount followingTrump's sweeping new tariffs, US media and internet companies face a potential multibillion-dollar hit to ad spending that could potentially deliver the death knell to traditional television advertising.\n\"Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,\" MoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman warned in a report last week.\nIf a recession were to materialize, MoffettNathanson estimates US ad spending would come in $45 billion below current forecasts.\nThat estimate would mean an 11.5 percentage point blow to top-line revenue growth across the media landscape. Digital platforms would bear the brunt, realizing $29 billion less in ad spending, with TV facing a $12 billion shortfall.\nRead more:What is a recession, and how does it impact you?\nEven before theTrump administration's April 2 announcementof a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all foreign imports, MoffettNathanson said companies were already in wait-and-see mode, holding back ad spending while trade policy remained unclear.\nRead more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\nIt's a stark reversal from the significant spending rebound the advertising industry enjoyed in 2024 on the back of record political spending, a booming economy, and lingering momentum from the post-pandemic digital and e-commerce boom.\nBut as MoffettNathanson argued, the tone has shifted from \"softly pessimistic\" to \"significantly more bearish.\"\n\"The shift is driven largely by the current administration's unorthodox and aggressive approach to addressing 'unfair' trade practices,\" the analysts said. \"The heightened uncertainty following the tariff announcement has led us to adopt a more cautious outlook for advertising.\"\nCompanies heavily reliant on advertising — like Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), and the Trade Desk (TTD) — would be hit \"disproportionately harder,\" with projected stock declines of at least 30% each, the firm estimates.\nDigital players with variable cost structures and less reliance on advertising, like Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), are \"better positioned to weather the storm.\"\nMeanwhile, connected TV player Roku (ROKU) would see the biggest relative impact, flipping from positive earnings in 2024 to a net loss in both 2025 and 2026, according to MoffettNathanson's projections.\nParamount could also reverse recent positive earnings trends, and other traditional media names like Disney (DIS), Fox (FOX), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) would likely see earnings per share (EPS) declines of around 20% to 25%.\nAs earnings season kicks off, some clarity on the outlook may emerge. But if a US recession takes hold, a drop in ad spending could send lasting ripple effects across a broad spectrum of companies, regardless of their size.\nAs a UBS analyst said in a separate client note sent Tuesday: \"Advertising is usually the first to go in an economic downturn as companies look to cut expenses.\"\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nVanguard has made it easy for anyone to invest in the stock market. The company offers a growing list of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow you to invest broadly in the stock market or focus on specific themes or types of stocks.\nOne of its many funds is theVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG). It's one of the smartest funds to buy because it tracks the performance of companies that grow their dividends. Historically, dividend growth stocks have delivered the highest total returns with the lowest risk. That makes this a great fund to buy and hold for 20 years to growyourwealth.\nTheVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETFaims to track the performance of theS&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. The managers of that index designed it to measure the performance of U.S. companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least the past 10 years.Of note, it excludes the top 25% highest-yielding dividend stocks because these companies typically have higher dividend payout ratios and lower growth profiles. Those characteristics put them at a higher risk of stopping growth or reducing their dividends in the future.\nThe ETF's focus on companies that grow their dividends and are at lower risk for a future reduction is worth noting, given the data on dividend stocks by their policies:\nDividend Policy\nAverage Annual Total Returns\nDividend growers and initiators\n10.2%\nDividend payers\n9.2%\nNo change in dividend policy\n6.8%\nDividend cutters and eliminators\n(0.9%)\nDividend non-payers\n4.3%\nEqual-weighted S&P 500 index\n7.7%\nData sources: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\nAs that table shows, dividend growers have produced the best returns among dividend stocks by policy while also significantly outperforming non-dividend-payers.\nThe ETF has delivered similarly strong returns throughout its history. Since its inception in 2006, the ETF has produced a 9.6% annualized return. Meanwhile, its return over the past 10 years is 11.3%. To put that into perspective, $2,000 invested into the fund at its inception nearly 20 years ago would have grown into about $12,500 today at a 9.6% average annual return.\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF currently holds 337 stocks. It has a higher weighting toward the biggest dividend growth stocks bymarket cap. Currently, the top 10 holdings comprise nearly 32% of its assets.\nHowever, these are the cream of the cropwhen it comes todividend growth stocks. For example, the fund's top holding is tech titanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), at 4.9% of the fund. The company has increased its payout for 14 straight years while growing it at a nearly 8% annual rate over the past decade. While Apple currently offers a low dividend yield of 0.5%, that payout is extremely safe. Apple produced nearly $30 billion in cash from operating activities last quarter, easily covering its $3.8 billion dividend outlay. Meanwhile, with its earnings up 10% last quarter and growing, Apple should have no trouble continuing to increase its dividend in the future.\nApple isjustone of the many high-quality dividend growth stocks among the fund's top 10 holdings. Other notable names areVisa, with 16 years of dividend increases;ExxonMobil, with 42 years of dividend growth; andWalmart, with 52 years of increasing its dividend.\nOne finalthing to point outis that because the fund focuses on dividend growth and excludes higher-yielding dividend stocks, it has a lower dividend yield than some other dividend-focused ETFs: It recently yielded around 1.7%. However, the fund should still deliver attractive total returns in the future as the underlying companies grow their earnings and dividends, which should steadily increase their stock prices.\nDividend growth stocks have historically outperformedotherdividend stocks and dividend non-payers over the long term. Given its focus on dividend growth stocks, buying the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is wise. The fund should deliver strong total returns over the decades,which should enableinvestorsto meaningfully increase their wealth by buying and holding this fund.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF wasn’t one of them.

In the video, posted on X by CNBC TV18 reporter Nigel D’Souza, Cook dismissed the idea that Apple’s manufacturing in China is due to low labor costs, stating, “China stopped being a low labor cost company many years ago.”\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26\/share with a $1000 minimum.\nInstead, he emphasized China’s unparalleled skilled labor concentration in one location and advanced tooling capabilities as the primary reason. Cook emphasized that “the products that we do require truly advanced tooling.”\n\nOn that note, Cook emphasized the sharp difference in vocational skills between the US and China. The Apple CEO stated, \"In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I’m not we could fill the room.\" In China, however, \"you could fill multiple football fields.... Hence, the vocational expertise in China is very deep”.\nWhy It Matters: The U.S.-China tariff war has put pressure on American companies to shift production back home. Earlier this month, a leading tech analyst predicted asignificant price hikefor Apple iPhones if manufacturing shifts to the U.S., potentially reaching around $3,500. This is due to the complexity of recreating the production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\nFurthermore, experts opined that Apple’s supply chain could face major disruptions due to new reciprocal tariffs. Apple had temporarily dodged steep tariffs on Chinese-made electronics following an exemption granted by Trump.\nA recent report also suggested that Apple completed an urgent logistics operation, transporting five planeloads of iPhones and other products from manufacturing centers in India and China to the U.S. within 72 hours, in a bid to beat PresidentDonald Trump's new 10% reciprocal tariff on imports.\nGiven these complexities, Cook’s emphasis on China’s skilled labor and advanced tooling capabilities provides a clearer understanding of Apple’s manufacturing decisions.\nApple has lost over $500 billion in market capitalization since the Apr 2 ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.

President Trump also posted on social media that there would be “no exception” for these products.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics, software, and services. The company is best known for its products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, as well as services such as the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the best American stocks to invest in.\nOn April 9, Jefferies upgraded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from “Underperform” to “Hold” but lowered the price target to $167.88 from the previous $202.33. This adjustment reflects concerns about the potential impacts of a global recession on iPhone demand and the expected price increases for future iPhone models. The analyst noted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to be exempted from US tariffs because of its commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years. The analyst believes that the company will make further investments in US manufacturing, possibly including iPhone production. Despite this, a growing risk of a global recession could have a negative impact on iPhone demand. Jefferies has lowered its iPhone shipment forecasts by 3.6%, 7.7%, and 5.5% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027 respectively, which leads to a reduction in projected revenue by 2%, 4.1%, and 3.5% for the same fiscal years. The firm anticipates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will raise iPhone prices by $50 in 2026 for the iPhone 18 and by $100 in 2027 for the iPhone 19. These increases in price are expected to be mainly driven by higher hardware costs. Following these revisions, Jefferies now estimates earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) lower than market consensus by 2.5%, 8.5%, and 3.4% for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\nOverall, AAPLranks 6thon our list of the best American tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple (AAPL,Financials) shares climbed about 2% to close at $202.52 on Monday after KeyBancupgraded the stock, citing the company's exemption from a new round of U.S. tariffs on tech imports.\nThe firm raised its rating on Apple to sector weight from underweight following the Trump administration's decision to exclude smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the latest reciprocal tariffs. KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said in a note that the decision significantly reduces the downside risk from a prolonged trade conflict between the United States and China.\nCiti maintained its outperform rating on Apple but lowered its sales projections for iPhones, Macs, and wearables. The bank cited expectations of a global economic slowdown due to the broader impact of tariffs, even as Apple's core products received exemptions. According to Citi, Apple remains vulnerable to weakening macroeconomic conditions.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the tariff exemption is not permanent and that the administration could introduce new tariffs within the next two months. That raises questions about how long the trade relief will benefit Apple and other tech companies.\nWedbush, which also has an outperform rating on the stock, said the temporary nature of the exemption creates space for potential negotiations between the United States and China. The firm noted that Apple and other major tech companies are closely watching for any developments that could renew trade tensions.\nDespite the recent gains, Apple shares are down nearly 20% since the start of the year.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nAfter years of teasing the idea, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isfinallymoving closer to launching its first foldable iPhoneand it's putting all its display chips on one bet. Sources say Apple has chosen Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier for the foldable OLED panels, citing Samsung's (SSNLF) technical lead in minimizing screen creasesarguably the make-or-break feature of a folding phone. Mass production is expected to kick off by late 2025 or early 2026, covering a 7.8-inch main display and a 5.5-inch external screen. For investors, this marks a rare moment when Apple ditches its usual playbook of sourcing from multiple suppliers to drive competition.\nWhat's striking is who's not on that list: LG Display. Despite being one of Apple's earliest partners in foldable tech, even co-developing prototype panels back in 2016 and forming a dedicated task force in 2017, LG is now sitting on the sidelines. While Apple's history suggests it could bring in LG for future models if sales scale, this first foldable looks like a one-brand show. The move underscores just how high the bar isand how dominant Samsung's foldable portfolio has become in the premium OLED space.\nFor Samsung Display, this deal isn't just about unitsit's about locking in pole position in the next-gen smartphone race. Apple's validation sends a strong signal to the market that Samsung's tech is years ahead when it comes to crease control and panel reliability. If the iPhone Fold takes off, expect this to be the start of a deeper AppleSamsung hardware alignmentand possibly a wake-up call for LG and BOE to rethink their roadmap.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nCould it be any clearer that Sam Altman intends for OpenAI to be a sprawling consumer tech company, not just an AI lab? His public comments certainly suggest as much. Today,The Vergereportedthat OpenAI has been working on an internal prototype of a social network that would let people share their AI-generated images.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nZillow turns full-blown housing market bear—just look at its new forecast\nApple canceled ‘Mythic Quest.’ Then it did something unheard of in the world of streaming TV\nWhat’s behind the rise in interim CEOs\nOpenAI began as a fairly rudderless little AI lab back in 2015. “We literally had no idea we were ever going to become a company—like, the plan was to put out research papers,” Altman said in a recentStratecheryinterview. “But there was no product, there was no plan for a product, there was no revenue, there was no business model, there were no plans for those things.”\nChatGPT changed everything. The AI chatbot took off like a rocket when it was quietly released to the public in late November 2022, soaring to 100 million users within weeks—faster than any consumer app in history. At the time, OpenAI was making some money by selling API access to its early models. But ChatGPT turned OpenAI into a consumer tech company. You simply don’t second-guess numbers like that.\nAnd the growth hasn’t stopped. “Something like 10% of the world uses our systems now a lot,” Altman said on April 11 at aTED event—a figure that implies OpenAI has around 800 million users. That’s why the company has been so busy adding new features and services to ChatGPT, now a household name. It’s added internet search, image generation, and deep research capabilities, with more surely on the way.\nIn hisStratecheryinterview, Altman even floated the idea of OpenAI offering something other tech giants—Apple, Google, Meta—already provide: a single sign-on for the web.\n“[W]e have this idea that you sign in with your OpenAI account to anybody else that wants to integrate the API, and you can take your bundle of credits and your customized model and everything else anywhere you want to go,” Altman toldStratechery’s Ben Thompson. “And I think that’s a key part of us really being a great platform.”\nThis vision ties neatly into Altman’s social network ambitions. Facebook parlayed its dominance into a single sign-on system that allowed it to follow users around the web, collecting data on the sites they visited and what they did there. OpenAI could similarly leverage a social network and single sign-on to gather valuable data to train future AI models. (OpenAI didn’t immediately respond toFast Company‘s request for comment.)\nThere are other signs of Altman’s ambition to broaden OpenAI’s scope—including hardware.\nThe company is reportedlyconsidering acquiringIo Products, a hardware startup cofounded by Altman and former Apple designer Jony Ive. The startup is developing a personal AI device designed to know all about the user and help with daily tasks. (Altman and OpenAI are also reportedly exploring designing their own AI chip, following in the footsteps of Amazon, Apple, and Google.)\nBut much of OpenAI’s time and energy in the coming years will likely be spent growing its breakout product, ChatGPT, into a full-fledged AI-first tech platform.\n“I really believe in this product suite,” Altman told Thompson. “I think that if we execute really well, five years from now, we have a handful of multibillion user products.”\nThis post originally appeared atfastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter:http:\/\/fastcompany.com\/newsletters",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nPresident Trump on Tuesday again toutedNvidia’s $500 billion commitmentto building AI infrastructure in the US, pledging to expedite the process for the chip giant and any other company planning big US investments.\n“This is very big and exciting news. All necessary permits will be expedited and quickly delivered to NVIDIA, as they will to all companies committing to be part of the Golden Age of America!” Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nNvidia's announcement brings Big Tech’s investment pledges to US AI infrastructure to just north of $1.6 trillion since Trump's inauguration as thetech world tries to navigate the potential hazards of the president's trade war while staying on the right side of a malleable administration.\nNvidia, for its part, did seem to make moves in US manufacturing partially due to Trump’s chaotic approach to trade policy, with on-again, off-again global tariffs affecting imports of AI servers containing its highly coveted GPUs, or graphics processing units.\nAsked about Trump’s tariffs at its annual GTC event in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was \"preparing, and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore.\" Huangreportedly attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lagolast week, after which the Trump administration backed off new restrictions on the company's chip exports to China.\nNvidia's moves are the latest in Big Tech's splashy announcements of plans to expand investments within the US.\nIn February, Apple (AAPL)committed to investing $500 billion to expand its US manufacturingover the next four years.\nTSMC (TSM) — which makes the world's most advanced chips with most of its manufacturing capacity in Taiwan —has committed to spending $100 billionover a similar time frame. The company had previously committed $65 billion to building out its US manufacturing capabilities with funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\nJust after Trump's inauguration, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and SoftBank (SFTBY) announceda joint venture called Stargate, which the companies said would spend $500 billion on US AI data centers.\nAnd after Trump's election, Microsoft (MSFT) said it wouldspend $80 billion to build AI data centers. The company said \"more than half\" of that total would be invested in the US.\nApple's US-centric moves have landed in the spotlight again amid Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Apple announced its $500 billion commitment just days afterTrump said CEO Tim Cookpromised him hundreds of millions of dollars in US investment and implied the pledge was due to his approach to trade policy.\n\"They don't want to be in the tariffs,\" Trump said in February.\nHowever,it’s unclear how much of Apple’s commitment will be from new investments, given that the spending announced was in line with its prior capital expenditures.\nNevertheless, Trump's relationship with Cook has weaved its way into tariff developments in the past several days. US Customs and Border Protectionissued regulations late Fridayexempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products — including GPUs and servers — from reciprocal tariffs.\nThat includes Trump's ever-ballooning 145% levies on China, where Apple still does most of its production. Trump boasted Monday that he \"helped Tim Cook recently.\"\n\"I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country,\" he said.\nBut Trump also set the stage to impose tariffs on semiconductors Tuesday —the Commerce Department opened a probe into computer chips under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which grants the president the authority to impose tariffs on imports seen as essential to national security. And he has promised that most electronics will still get wrapped up in his tariffs.\n\"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\" he posted Sunday.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nTo the relief of anyone with an aging iPhone, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech products from its punishing tariffs on Chinese imports over the weekend. WhileApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)has geographically diversified its supply chain, the company still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing partners for its devices. Absent any special treatment, prices in the U.S. on Apple products would have likely risen substantially due to the tariffs.\nWhile Apple is getting a big break, the relief may be short lived. President Trump later clarified that electronics like Apple's iPhones would be moving into a different tariff \"bucket.\" While Apple's devices may not be subject to the full tariff on Chinese imports, they may eventually be subject to some level of tariffs.\nEven if Apple somehow manages to avoid tariffs on its own products, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, along with the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's generaltariff policy, could hurt the company in another way.\nWhile predicting anything about the economy right now is tough, the odds of an economic downturn certainly appear to be rising as businesses and consumers cope with the impact of unpredictable and ever-changing tariffs. Consumer confidence plunged in March, according to The Conference Board, and consumers' short-term expectations regarding economic conditions reached their lowest level in 12 years. These drops were recorded before the Trump administration announced its reciprocal tariffs, which led to a sharp stock market plunge.\nSmartphones are an essential item for nearly everyone, but purchases can also be easily deferred. The replacement cycles for smartphones and other electronic devices have been lengthening already, and this effect could go into overdrive during a recession. If smartphones also become more expensive due to tariffs, the replacement cycle could lengthen further.\nApple Intelligence, Apple's take onAI-powered featuresfor its devices, probably won't save the day and induce many iPhone users to upgrade. Apple is reportedly having all sorts of problems with a revamped version of Siri, which raises questions about when the promised AI features will arrive and how useful they will be.\nNew hardware probably won't help, either. The smartphone market is mature, and annual upgrades don't introduce much more than slightly better performance or other modest improvements. Without a good reason to upgrade, it won't be much of a sacrifice for consumers to kick the can down the road during a recession.\nDespite iPhone sales flatlining and the tariff uncertainty, Apple stock trades for around 28 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025. Analysts are still assuming, by the way, that Apple will manage to grow earnings significantly this year. That forecast could turn out to be overly optimistic depending on how the tariff situation plays out.\nI'm not convinced Apple stock deserves that kind of valuation, given all the headwinds facing the company. The iPhone business was already struggling to grow, and an economic slowdown isn't going to help matters. Even if Apple manages to stay out of the tariff crosshairs, sales and profits look likely to take a hit this year. Given the risks, Apple stock looks too expensive.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nOn April 11, 2025, just days after announcing new tariffs, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, laptops, processors, displays, and memory chips from tariffs, only to later clarify that this was a temporary reprieve.\nThe US government is set to reassess the entire consumer electronics supply chain amid an investigation into semiconductors, which may soon face tariffs. Earlier last week, the president also announced a 90-day suspension of ‘reciprocal’ tariffs for most trading partners. Concurrently, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an unprecedented 145%. This indicates a strong push for US production of consumer devices, including Apple iPhones. The pressing question is whether Apple can manufacture its products domestically.\nManufacturing Apple devices in the US is possible but would require significant investment and effort from Apple and governmental bodies, both present and future, with years of business disruption in between.\nChina has developed a robust consumer electronics ecosystem over decades, with a vast network of suppliers, skilled labor, efficient infrastructure, and ample production sites. Consequently, more than half of Apple’s 200 global suppliers are based in China, where a skilled workforce and favourable conditions for large-scale manufacturing exist.\nReplicating this in the US would necessitate attracting skilled labour, reforming educational pathways, and fostering a culture that values higher education—actions that are not currently aligned with the administration's policies, as evidenced by the recent immigration uproar and the gutting of the US Department of Education. These tariffs, therefore, appear to be geopolitical trade instruments plainly intended to secure more advantageous agreements.\nIf Apple cannot secure long-term tariff exemptions, then the cost of its devices will likely rise.\nCurrently, 80% of Apple’s overall products are assembled in China, and a 145% tariff could increase the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max to more than $2,600. Apple has begun diversifying production to India and Vietnam, moving about 15-20% of its production there, but remains heavily reliant on China, where 90% of iPhones are still assembled.\nIn the meantime, Apple is stockpiling millions of iPhones, with reports of five planeloads of phones and accessories flying into the US from India in the three days following the April 2 tariff communication. However, the upcoming iPhone 17 series, produced in China, may face tariffs, complicating pricing strategies and potentially dampening consumer demand.\nApple faces a potential crisis. Should the company be compelled to shift production to the US, it will encounter insurmountable challenges in meeting its current scale of shipments. The company is at risk of a supply-demand imbalance if forced to shift production to the US, which could lead to higher prices and lost sales.\nApple's challenges are compounded in China, its third largest market, by growing negative American sentiment and competition from local Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Vivo, which are gaining market share due to their technological advancements, as well as their progressiveness in AI. Additionally, rival Samsung's diversified supply chain – spread across Vietnam, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea – gives it a competitive edge, as the company is less over exposed to China compared with Apple.\nSuffice it to say that Apple has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since its potential bankruptcy in 1997.\n\"US tariffs: Can Apple manufacture in the US?\" was originally created and published byVerdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

This integration aligns with broader market trends where tech stocks led indices higher amid President Trump’s tariff exemption for electronics, which added a positive sentiment across the tech sector. Apple's integration with CONNEQT Health is a strategic move to enhance its health-focused offerings, adding depth to its ecosystem. The broader tech rally, including a 7% market gain, added support to Apple's robust performance, painting a positive picture for the week.\nApple has 1 weakness we think you should know about.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 20 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nThe integration of CONNEQT Health with Apple Health potentially enhances Apple's narrative by reinforcing its expansion in health-focused services.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks to watch amid market volatility.\nThe uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains. The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components.\nREAD ALSO:14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attentionand9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today.\nThe narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings.\nIn the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.\n“Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.”\nIt also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.”\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On April 14, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on the stock to $245 from $270 and kept an “Overweight” rating on the shares. The firm expressed its relief after Trump recently announced that the reciprocal tariffs will exempt smartphones and PCs. The analyst told investors in a research note how these exemptions will help investors refocus on the company’s medium-term drivers. Regardless, “several concerns” remain from the developments over the last two weeks that will inhibit these very investors from turning to a bull case for Apple stock. The firm further announced that semiconductor tariffs are yet to be announced and could impact Apple.\nOverall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of AI stocks to watch amid market volatility.

The foldable device is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch internal OLED screen, similar in size to the iPad Mini, and a 5.5-inch external display. The price could land near $2,000, putting it in direct competition with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold.\nThe production volume is still under discussion, but industry insiders suggest Apple may exceed its initial target of 9 million units, potentially reaching over 15 million.\nThe deal could help Samsung make up for its loss of foldable OLED market share last year that dropped to around 40% and reach 70% in 2025 as demand for the technology soars and competition dwindles, analysts say.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

The company has selected Samsung Display as the exclusive supplier of OLED panels for the device, marking a rare shift from its usual multi-supplier strategy.\nIndustry sources say Apple chose Samsung for its proven ability to reduce screen creasesa crucial issue for foldable phones. The panels will likely resemble those used in the iPad Mini, with a 7.8-inch internal screen and a 5.5-inch external display. Pricing is expected to start around $2,000, putting it head-to-head with Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold lineup.\nSamsung Display is expected to start deliveries by late 2025 or early 2026. The exclusive contract could help the company reclaim lost ground in the foldable OLED market, where its share had dropped to about 40% last year. Analysts now expect that number to climb back toward 70% in 2026, boosted by Apple's order.\nInitial projections put the foldable iPhone's annual production at 9 million units, but some forecasts now see it surpassing 15 million. That kind of volume could breathe new life into the sluggish foldable segment, which saw just 2.9% growth last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nThe move is also seen as a strategic signal from Appleit's placing quality above price and taking a careful but deliberate step into a new product category. Details like the phone's final design or name haven't been confirmed yet, but its success could shape Apple's future in foldable devices, including iPads and laptops.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump “has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.” Desai added, “At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.” Dan Ives, head of technology research at Wedbush, told CNBC, “This is the dream scenario for tech investors. Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.”\nPresident Donald Trump stated in a Truth Socialpost, “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.”\nBIG RELIEF:JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on Apple(AAPL) to $245 from $270 but kept an Overweight rating on the shares, saying the latest updates from the Trump administration late on Friday, exempting smartphones and PCs from reciprocal tariffs, is a “big relief” for Apple. While the exemption will help return investor focus back to some of the company’s medium-term drivers, “several concerns” remain from the developments over the last two weeks, the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan thinks these will “limit investors from immediately turning to any bull case” for Apple.Semiconductortariffs are still to be announced and could impact Apple, adds the firm. JPMorgan updated its estimates for lower demand from the macro slowdown and potential further downside risk on the resumption of tariffs. It forecasts slowing demand from fiscal Q4 into fiscal 2026 and revised its fiscal 2026 and 2027 iPhone volume expectations to 232M and 242M, respectively, from 249M and 255M units prior.\nDEPORTATION EFFORTS:Prison operatorGeoGroup(GEO)has built a lucrative side business of digital tools to surveil immigrants on behalf of the federal government over the last decade, making it one of the Trump administration’s big business winners amid deportations, the New York Times’ Paul Mozur, Adam Satariano and Aaron Krolikreport, citing legal aid groups and immigration organizations. The company’s ankle monitors, smart watches and tracking apps are aiding the government by providing the locations of unauthorized immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and legal groups estimate the number of arrests made from the digital monitoring programs is at least in the hundreds.\nU.S. STEEL:U.S President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he does not believe a foreign company should control U.S. Steel(X), following similar comments he made regarding the $15B takeover bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel(NPSCY), Reuters’ Jeff Mason and Kantaro Komiyareport, citing remarks Trump made to reporters. On Wednesday, Trump stated that he didn’t want to see the company “go to Japan” causing a 7% drop in the company’s stock value. Following the comment, both companies stated they were collaborating with the administration “to secure a significant investment”, however on Sunday, Trump affirmed his stance, saying, “I don’t think a foreign company should control U.S. Steel.”\nPublished first onTheFly– the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.Try Now>>\nSee today’s best-performing stocks on TipRanks >>\nRead More on AAPL:\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue\nApple upgraded, Wayfair downgraded: Wall Street’s top analyst calls\nUnusually active option classes on open April 14th\nApple price target lowered to $230 from $290 at DA Davidson\nMorning Movers: Goldman Sachs gains following first quarter results\nNotable open interest changes for April 14th",

Trump has since paused most duties, except for China for three months.\nFoxconn, Apple's main India supplier, exported smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, its highest ever for a single month and equal to shipments for January and February combined, according to commercially available customs data reviewed by Reuters.\nThis included Apple iPhone 13, 14, 16 and 16e models, and took Foxconn's total shipments from India to the United States this year to $5.3 billion.\nExports from Tata Electronics, another Apple supplier, stood at $612 million in March, around 63% higher than the previous month, and included iPhone 15 and 16 models.\nApple, Foxconn and Tata did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters is the first to report the shipment details.\nCustoms data showed all Foxconn shipments to the United States in March were by air from the Chennai Air Cargo terminal, and landed at various locations, including Los Angeles and New York, with Chicago receiving the majority.\nTrump later granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, but later indicated that those exemptions will likely be short-lived.\nTo expedite shipments, Apple lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to six hours down from 30 hours.\nAt least six cargo jets were used in the operation which one source described was a way to \"beat the tariffs\".\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Sharon Singleton)",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple(AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 points to a change of +6.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.03 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $93.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $404.46 billion and $431.42 billion estimates indicate +3.4% and +6.7% changes, respectively.\nApple reported revenues of $124.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $2.40 for the same period compares with $2.18 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.24%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest company in the world, with a market cap of $2.987 trillion. It designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories worldwide.\nIt will report its Q2 2025 earnings on May 1. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post EPS of $1.61, up from $1.53 in the prior-year period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $94.07 billion, up from $90.75 billion a year earlier.\nThe 52-week range of Apple stock price was $164.08 to $260.09.\nApple's dividend yield is 0.50%. It paid $1 per share in dividends during the last 12 months.\nDon't Miss:\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26\/share with a $1000 minimum.\nAre you rich?Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\nOn Jan 30, the company announced its Q1 2025 earnings, posting revenue of $124.3 billion, beating analyst estimates of $124.13 billion, as reported byBenzinga. The iPhone maker reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.40 per share, beating analyst estimates of $2.36 per share.\nApple shares have nosedived since the announcement of ‘Liberation Day' tariffs on April 2, sparking investor panic over potential supply chain disruptions and weakening sales in China.\nHowever, the stock staged a dramatic rebound on Wednesday, closing with a gain of over 15%, after PresidentDonald Trumpannounced a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that have not retaliated against U.S. trade actions.\nCheck out thisarticle by Benzingafor Apple’s latest options trends.\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\"Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nIf you want to make $100 per month — $1,200 annually — from Apple dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $240,000, which is around 1,207 shares at $198.85 each.\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations:When making an estimate, you need two key variables — the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (0.50% in this case). So, $1,200 \/ 0.005 = $240,000 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.\nThe dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nSee Also: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet.See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation.\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2\/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2\/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2\/$40).\nIn summary, income-focused investors may find Apple stock an attractive option for making a steady income of $100 per month by owning 1,207 shares of stock. There may be more upside to come as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes. Apple has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 12 years.\nRead Next:\nHave $200K saved?Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets –with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26\/share!\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.Click now to access unique insightsthat can set you ahead in today's competitive market.\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis articleHere's How You Can Earn $100 In Passive Income By Investing In Apple Stockoriginally appeared onBenzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nGood morning. Tariff wars may cause manyApplecustomers to rethink their loyalty to avoid high prices.\n“If the 145% China tariffs came into play, we believe Apple would have no choice but to start charging $2,000-plus for iPhone Pro once inventory levels came down,” Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note on Sunday.\nThe tech giant has developed a loyal fan base of customers willing to pay premium prices for their products, like iPhones. Product differentiation, brand equity, and perception of value are part of the company’s strategy. However, research shows that increasing pricescan negativelyimpact customer loyalty. And adding exorbitant costs to Apple customers would be a dealbreaker for many, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director, told me.\nIves put it to me this way: “If someone charged you $7 for a slice of pizza, even the best slice of pizza, you wouldn’t buy it. So everything has a price.” As someone who grew up eating New York pizza, that resonated with me.\nIt seems Apple may have some breathing room before considering raising prices for U.S. customers. The Trump administration announced late Friday thatsome electronics, such as smartphones, were temporarily exempted from the 145% import tariffs on goods from China. That’s some relief for Apple, a company that assembles devices in China and imports them.\nHowever, the break could be short-lived as in asocial media poston Sunday, President Trump said “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook'” while adding that the exempted products are “just moving to a different tariff ‘bucket.’”\nThe impending tariffs and uncertainty could mean a change to Apple’s pricing strategy, which its new CFO had no intention to alter. Apple SVP and CFO Kevan Parekh began on Jan. 1, succeeding former CFO Luca Maestri, who held the role for over 10 years. Maestri leads the corporate services teams. Parekh participated in his first earnings call on Jan. 30 regarding the quarter that ended Dec. 28. An analyst noted that one of Maestri’s legacies was maintaining consistent pricing across the product range.\n“I don’t think we’re going to really depart from what served us pretty well,” Parekhsaid on the call. Apple has had a “disciplined pricing strategy,” he said. “We’re going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.”\nAmid ongoing tariff uncertainty, many Apple customers areflocking to storesto make purchases before any potential price bumps. “When you create that level of uncertainty, it causes chaos in the supply chain,” Ives said.\nApple is facing a situation where CEO Tim Cook knows what is coming down the road and needs to make some adjustments, Wedbush analyst wrote in the Sunday note. “Cook being 10% politician and 90% CEO is an asset for Apple (and its investors) in this situation,” according to the note.\nSherylEstradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple is preparing to implement a new system that will analyse user data directly on its devices, aiming to strengthen AI capabilities without compromising privacy,Bloomberghas reported.\nThe move will mark a shift from the company’s prior exclusive reliance on synthetic data for training AI models, which can sometimes fall short of accurately representing real-world user behaviour.\nThe upcoming change targets limitations in Apple’s current approach, where synthetic data—designed to mimic real inputs without containing personal information—fails to fully capture the complexity of actual user interactions.\nThe new system, by contrast, will use anonymised samples of user emails from Apple’s Mail app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac to validate the quality of synthetic datasets.\nApple said this process will help it refine features within its Apple Intelligence platform, such as notification summaries, Writing Tools synthesis, and message recaps, without transmitting personal data off the device.\nIn a blog post, the company said: “When creating synthetic data, our goal is to produce synthetic sentences or emails that are similar enough in topic or style to the real thing to help improve our models for summarisation, but without Apple collecting emails from the device.”\nApple Intelligence, launched in 2024, is built on large language models, a foundational technology in modern AI.\nIn addition to synthetic data, Apple has used licensed third-party data and information from publicly available online sources to train these models.\nHowever, the limitations of synthetic data have reportedly led to shortcomings in the system’s performance, including inaccurate summaries and misrepresented content in notifications.\nThe new data analysis system will be introduced in beta versions of iOS and iPadOS 18.5 and macOS 15.5.\nApple also confirmed it is expanding its use of privacy-preserving techniques to enhance other features within Apple Intelligence.\nThese include Image Playground, Image Wand, Memories Creation, and Visual Intelligence.\nOne such method, differential privacy, has already been employed to improve the Genmoji feature, which allows users to create custom emojis.\nDifferential privacy enables the identification of common user prompts while mathematically safeguarding individual data points.\n\"Apple to begin on-device data analysis to enhance AI\" was originally created and published byVerdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nChicago, IL – April 15, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple Inc AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nWith new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncandNVIDIA Corporationsaw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let’s explore –\nPresident Trump’s steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple’s supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs.\nBefore the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand.\nHowever, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes.\nA complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities.\nHowever, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple’s near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn’t acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple’s sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple’s stagnating revenues.\nGiven the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn’t a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price\/earnings (P\/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry’s forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved.\nLike Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump’s tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists.\nHowever, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA’s long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook.\nComing back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company’s CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.andAlphabet Inc.are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?).\nNVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P\/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry’s 28.4X forward earnings multiple. This leads to NVIDIA having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, whereas Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nWhat matters in U.S. and global markets today\nBy Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial Markets\nThe combination of an electronics tariff reprieve and dovish noises from the Federal Reserve have created a semblance of calm in financial markets, though the lingering trade war uncertainty means the respite probably won't last long.\nI'll discuss all of today's market news below.\nToday's Market Minute\n* The Trump administration is proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on national security grounds, Federal Register filings on Monday showed.\n* The dollar held steady on Tuesday, trading near a three-year low against the euro and a six-month trough against the yen, as investors trying to make sense of the constant changes to President Donald Trump's tariffs remained wary of U.S. assets.\n* LVMH shares sank on Tuesday after the world's largest luxury group posted first quarter revenue that undershot expectations as U.S. shoppers curtailed the purchase of beauty products and cognac and sales in China remained weak.\n* South Korea announced on Tuesday an increase in its support package for the country's vital semiconductor industry to 33 trillion won ($23.25 billion), up about a quarter from a 26 trillion won package unveiled last year.\n* Euro zone banks curbed firms' access to credit last quarter and expect to keep tightening credit standards due to increasing concerns about the economic outlook, the European Central Bank's lending survey showed on Tuesday.\nFed gives market a breather\nTech shares, including Apple, rallied on Monday after President Donald Trump excluded smartphones, computers and other electronics from his sweeping reciprocal duties on China, even while suggesting there would be an alternative tariff regime for the sector.\nThe move was Trump's second climb down since the April 2 tariff shock. It was welcomed as such by investors, but it does little to defuse the huge uncertainty over what happens next.\nThe Trump administration is now proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors and could potentially use national security grounds to impose tariffs there.\nEven though the S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher on Monday, it remains 4% below levels present just before April 2's announcement and 8% down for the year to date. Implied volatility captured by the VIX remains above 30, almost 50% higher than historical averages.\nCitigroup joined a string of brokerages, including Goldman Sachs and BofA, in slashing its S&P 500 target below the 6000 mark, with the bank's year-end target now at 5800, compared with a previous estimate of 6500. As it stands, that's still 7.5% above Monday's close.\nHowever, investors were glad to see fears ease about stock market volatility seeping into the 'safe haven' Treasury market. Fed Governor Christopher Waller made dovish signals on Monday, suggesting the net impact of all the tariff hits would be negative for growth, with inflationary effects likely transitory.\n\"With a rapidly slowing economy, even if inflation is running well above 2%, I expect the risk of recession would outweigh the risk of escalating inflation, especially if the effects of tariffs in raising inflation are expected to be short lived,\" he said.\nWaller's comments helped drag 10-year Treasury yields back as low as 4.35%, a quarter percentage point below the peaks of last week.\nThe New York Fed's consumer survey offered some support for the Fed governor's take on inflation, with one-year inflation expectations jumping to the highest in more than a year, while three- and five-year views remained steady or lower.\nHowever, one-year inflation expectations in the University of Michigan's household survey for April rose to their highest since 1981. And an Reuters\/IPSOS opinion poll shows 73% of respondents said they thought prices in the next six months would increase for the items they buy every day.\nOther Fed officials indicated that it would be wise to stand pat for the time being, as the outcome of tariff policies obviously can't be measured if you don't know where that policy will actually end up.\n\"The fog has just gotten really, really thick,\" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said.\nThe bond yield retreat kept the dollar on the back foot, even with interest rate cuts expected from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada this week.\nSterling was the outperformer, rising to its strongest levels in six months against the dollar.\nOverseas stocks in Asia and Europe were generally firmer, even though luxury-sector bellwether LVMH dropped 7% after its latest update said sales in China were weak and U.S. shoppers had cut spending on beauty products in the first quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures were basically flat before Tuesday's bell.\nFinally, check out my column today, where I explore rising speculation about repatriation of European savings from wobbling U.S. markets and how those investment flows could underwrite the huge fiscal boost that Germany and the rest of Europe hopes will revive the region's economy.\nChart of the day\nApple has found itself at the centre of Donald Trump's trade war storm over the past week. It had been scrambling to contend with potentially brutal tariff rises on its Chinese production lines. This included chartering cargo flights to ferry some 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India in the process. The crunch may be one reason Trump exempted many electronics, including smartphones, from his sweeping reciprocal duties on China.\nFirst quarter data just released shows Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. Apple had 19% of the smartphone market, despite flat or declining sales in the U.S., Europe and China, followed by Samsung with 18% of the market.\nToday's events to watch\n* New York Federal Reserve's April manufacturing survey, U.S. March import\/export prices; Canada March CPI inflation\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin speak; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks\n* US corporate earnings: Bank of America, Citigroup, PNC, Omnicom, Johnson&Johnson, United Airlines, JB Hunt\n* China's President Xi Jinping visits Malaysia and Cambodia\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s Fair Trade Commission ordered Alphabet Inc.’s Google to stop alleged abuse of its market power over local smartphone manufacturers, just ahead of high-stakes trade negotiations with the US this week.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\n$15 Million Fund Bets Leadership Training Can Improve Chicago Policing\nLA County Floats Leaner Budget Burdened by Fire and Legal Costs\nThe Tuesday order reiterates the FTC’s earlier finding that the US tech giant took advantage of its position as the provider of the Google Play app ecosystem — the only viable alternative to the iPhone’s App store. Google is improperly forcing phone makers to prioritize its apps and services on their devices in exchange for allowing them to put the app store on phones sold in Japan, the regulator said. The US company said in a statement it was disappointed with the findings and will review the order before deciding next steps.\nThe announcement comes just ahead of Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa’s planned visit to the US this week to press for a reprieve from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Japanese products.\nThe watchdog’s move also follows a complaint by the Office of the US Trade Representative that Japan’s Digital Platform Act — geared to boost transparency from large technology providers — disproportionately affects American companies and undermines their competitiveness in Japan by increasing compliance costs.\nJapan’s cease-and-desist order marks the country’s first such command to any leading US tech firm. But it’s a straggler among regulators overseas. The EU has rebuked both Google and Apple for using what it alleges are illegal tactics to dominate mobile software markets, while the US Justice Department is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business after a federal judge ruled the company illegally monopolized the search market.\n“It’s not like Japan is the only country that’s targeted certain US companies,” FTC Director General Masaru Ogo said in response to questions about how the move might affect US-Japan tariff discussions. “We don’t think this will be a big problem.”\nWhile the US runs a goods deficit with Japan, it has a surplus in services, which includes licensing fees for Android’s app ecosystem as well as advertising revenue. Last year, the US sold more than $45 billion in seasonally adjusted services to Japan.\nGoogle allegedly capitalized on the struggles of Android smartphone makers selling handsets in Japan to retain market share in a country where Apple Inc. is by far the leading smartphone brand. Google demanded the phone makers — which include Sony Group Corp. and Sharp Corp. — bundle the Chrome browser and the Google search box widget and promote it on each handset’s home screen as must-have conditions when making contracts to provide the Google Play store app, according to the FTC. The manufacturers complied, because that app ecosystem is indispensable to deliver phones that can stand toe to toe with Apple’s handsets.\nMountain View, California-based Google also offered to share ad revenue with device makers if they agreed not to preload search engines from its rivals, the FTC said. Google places a high priority on ensuring it’s the first search service users see when they get a new phone, paying Apple billions each year to secure that spot on iPhones.\nAs of December last year, Google had contracts with six handset makers that mandated installing the Google widget and app, the FTC said. It had inappropriate revenue share programs with four handset makers and one wireless carrier as of July 2024, it said.\nFailure on the part of Google to comply may result in fines or criminal punishment, officials said. The move gives handset makers more freedom to decide what apps to preload and provides opportunities for Google’s rivals, said Saiko Nakajima, senior investigator for digital platform operators.\n“The FTC will will continue to take proactive, strict and appropriate action when it comes in contact with information that is suspected of violating the law in the digital field,” Ogo said.\n--With assistance from Yoshiaki Nohara.\n(Updates with comments from Google and FTC from the second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nHow Mar-a-Lago Memberships Explain Trump’s Tariff Obsession\nTrade Tensions With China Clear Path for Salt-Powered Batteries\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Investors momentarilypoured back into Big Techafter the administration initiateda temporary levy exemptionthat covers consumer electronics, networking equipment, GPUs, and servers.\nIt's essentially another way of saying that Big Tech will probably be OK, as investors alsolook to the sector as a defensive play. Meanwhile, other sectors and companies still stare down amassive tariff upheaval.\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy\nIt's a feature of American politics to want to avoid the appearance of picking winners and losers in the market. That phrase is often used as a rhetorical cudgel to attack opponents as bad for the economy.\nBut one person's favoritism is another's industrial policy.\nIf the market is consumed by the repercussions of tariffs, exemptions to those taxes can mean everything.The potential special carve-outs for tech, however, initially sparked a rally on Monday, fizzled, then rebounded. Part of this confused response from investors was the White Houseseemingly sending mixed signals.\nAfter the exclusions from reciprocal tariffs were first unveiled, the president said in a social media post \"there was no Tariff 'exception' announced.\" He later told reporters that his goal was encouraging production to move to the US but added that the administration has to show flexibility.\nThe tech titans hoping to receive assistance from the White House are showing flexibility too, or rathera willingness to support the president's agendaof bolstering domestic manufacturing and investment.\nNvidia (NVDA) on Monday said it willproduce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructurein the US within the next four years. That announcement follows other Big Tech commitments from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) to spend in the US.\nRecent trading sessions with wild upward swings have made one thing clear: Pronouncements on tariffs arethe only meaningful catalyst for stocksin this uncertain moment.\nThat goes for Big Tech too, whose trillion-dollar tickers are buoyed by global supply chains and customer bases all around the world. It's true that their size and market heft might allow these companies to weather whatever tariff costs come. But people are intimately familiar with how much, say, a phone costs, making a sudden upcharge on a finished product an unsavory consumer experience. It is, perhaps, the modern price of bread.\nOverall, the dizzying tariff news, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients, is \"a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names.\" It creates the space for some sort of negotiation with China, he said, and can lead to a deescalation of the trade war issues that have left Big Tech caught in the middle.\nTheir importance for American tech supremacy means, in a way, they are too important to fail, and the value they bring to the stock market makes the rest of the S&P seem like lesser moons in a solar system that revolves around them.\nBut in this chaotic environment, the most important distinction of all isn't size alone; it's a tariff carve-out.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nTheS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)is made up of 500 companies from 11 different economic sectors. The information technology sector is the largest by a wide margin, representing 29.9% of the entire value of the index.\nThe S&P 500 recently suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 19%, falling just shy of the bear-market threshold of 20%. However, theS&P 500 Information Technologyindex plunged by as much as 26%, placing it firmly in bear territory.Apple,Microsoft, andNvidiaare just some of the heavyweights in the information technology sector, so it's a good proxy for the performance of some of America's most valuable companies.\nTheVanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT)exclusively invests in stocks from the information technology sector (including those inside and outside the S&P 500), and it has outperformed the S&P 500 every year, on average since it was established in 2004. Therefore, investors with a spare $550 might want to take the opportunity to buy one share in this fund while it's trading at a discount during the tech bear market.\nOn April 2, President Trump announced plans to impose a sweeping 10%tariffon all physical products imported into America, in addition to a series of much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods from specific countries. The reciprocal tariffs have since been paused for 90 days pending negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, except for those placed on China, which remain active.\nSweeping tariffs have immediately increased the cost of living for consumers, which could dent America's economic growth. Plus, some countries have imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, which will also hurt U.S. exporters. This is a cocktail for weaker corporate earnings, which is whythe S&P 500 suffered such a sharp declineover the last few weeks.\nHowever, many of the products and services produced by companies in the information technology sector aren't directly affected by the tariffs, which is why I believe the sector's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 represents a big opportunity for investors. For example, semiconductors have been excluded from President Trump's tariffs from the beginning, which means the industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips produced by companies like Nvidia andBroadcomwon't be affected.\nMoreover, Microsoft primarily sells digital products like the Windows operating system and 365 productivity suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), in addition to cloud services through its Azure platform. None of those are subject to the tariffs (for now). Further, last weekend, President Trump announced that smartphones and computers will be removed from the reciprocal tariffs that are still in place on imports from China. This significantly benefits Apple, which manufactures around 90% of its iPhones in that country.\nBelow is a list of other holdings in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF that primarily sell software, cloud services, digital products, or exempted products like semiconductors:\nStock\nVanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting\nSalesforce\n1.78%\nOracle\n1.72%\nAccenture\n1.38%\nAdobe\n1.22%\nPalantir Technologies\n1.13%\nQualcomm\n1.12%\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n1.02%\nPalo Alto Networks\n0.81%\nMicron Technology\n0.68%\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD)\n0.63%\nData source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Feb. 28, 2025, and are subject to change.\nThe Vanguard ETF holds 314 different stocks. However, the above 10 stocks, combined with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, account for a whopping 61.7% of the entire value of its portfolio.\nWith all of that said, even though the above companies aren't directly impacted by tariffs, they are likely to suffer indirect consequences from President Trump's trade policies. If the U.S. economy does slow down, they will experience weaker demand for their products and services. This effect could be especially pronounced for the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, which are relying on hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure spending from just a handful of customers each year to fuel their growth.\nSome of that potential risk is already priced in. Nvidia stock, for instance, is down by 25% from its record high, wiping a staggering $900 billion off the company's market capitalization. That reduces the potential downside risk for investors who swoop in and buy the Vanguard ETF today.\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF was recently down by as much as 27% from its record high, so it's heavily underperforming the S&P 500 at the moment. However, the picture looks very different when we zoom out and examine its long-term performance.\nThe Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 12.8% since it was established in 2004, comfortably beating the average annual gain of 9.6% in the S&P 500 over the same period. That 3.2 percentage point difference doesn't sound like much at face value, but it would have made a world of difference in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding:\nStarting Balance In 2004\nCompound Annual Return\nBalance In 2025\n$50,000\n12.8%\n$627,279\n$50,000\n9.6%\n$342,761\nCalculations by author.\nIn my view, even if the economy slows due to global trade tensions, investors are likely to continue buying quality stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. These companies have incredibly strong balance sheets with plenty of cash on hand, in addition to reliable earnings and leadership positions in their respective industries. They could still be the best houses in a bad neighborhood, so to speak, as the rest of the market faces the same economic challenges.\nPlus, PwC predicts the AI revolution will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and much of that value will be created by the companies in the information technology sector. As a result, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF might be a great buy during the tech bear market.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)stock returned 30% in 2024, peaking around $259 per share in late December. Factors contributing to that upside included strong sales growth in the services business and excitement about new artificial intelligence (AI) features. But those bright spots have since been overshadowed by economic uncertainty and trade tensions.\nPresident Trump on April 2 outlined an aggressive slate ofreciprocal tariffsthat would take the average tax on U.S. imports to its highest level in a century. While those duties have been paused for 90 days, tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports have not. And those duties may be especially problematic because Apple makes most of its iPhones in China.\nConsequently, Apple stock had tumbled 33% to $172 per share by early April. Interestingly, the stock previously fell more than 30% from its record high four times in the last decade, but it always rebounded sharply in the next year. Here's what investors should know.\nApple stock has declined more than 30% from a record high on four occasions since 2015, excluding the current situation. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but there is a clear pattern to those drawdowns: The stock has always recouped its losses and produced enormous returns during the next 12 months, as detailed below.\nApril 2015:Apple stock peaked at $33 per share in April 2015 before falling 32% to $22.50 per share in May 2016. That drawdown was due largely to disappointing financial results driven by weak iPhone sales, but investor confidence was restored as the company leaned into its burgeoning services business. Apple reached a new high in February 2017, and the stock returned 73% during the year after the first close 30% below its high.\nOctober 2018:Apple stock peaked at $58 per share in October 2018 before declining 38% to $36 per share in January 2019. The drawdown was primarily caused by a trade war with China. President Trump during his first term imposed tariffs that raised the average tax on Chinese imports from 3% in 2018 to 21% in 2020. But Apple hit a new high in October 2019, and the stock returned 74% in the year after the first close 30% below its high.\nFebruary 2020:Apple stock peaked around $82 per share in February 2020 before declining 31% to $56 per share in March 2020. The drawdown took place as investors panicked about the potential impact of Covid-19, which disrupted supply chains by forcing business closures around the world. But Apple reached a new high in June 2020, and the stock returned 119% during the year after the first close 30% below its high.\nJanuary 2022:Apple stock peaked at $182 per share in January 2022 before falling 31% to $125 per share in January 2023. The drawdown took place during anS&P 500bear market, which itself was brought on by recession fears stoked by runaway inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. But Apple reached a new high in June 2023, and the stock advanced 54% during the year following its first close 30% below its high.\nTo summarize, Apple stock has fallen more than 30% from its high four times since 2015, and it returned an average of 80% following its first close below that level. We can use that figure to make an educated guess about the future: Apple closed at $172 per share on April 8, the first close 30% below the record high it hit in December. The share price will increase 80% to $310 by April 2026 if performance matches the historical average, implying 51% upside from its current share price of $205.\nImportantly, how Apple stock actually performs depends on financial results, and tariffs pushed by the Trump administration have sewn a great deal of uncertainty on that front.\nPresident Trump has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on goods imported from China. That is nearly seven times higher than the average tariff on Chinese imports during his first term. How those duties will impact Apple, which makes 80% of its iPhones in China, is difficult to discern partially because trade policy seems to change almost daily.\nFor instance, U.S. Customs and Border Protection published a note this past weekend that seemingly excluded China-made smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the tariffs. But the narrative had shifted by Sunday, with President Trump saying no exceptions will be made. Instead, the administration says electronics will be subject to separate tariffs that take effect in a month or two.\nBeyond China, Apple also manufactures a significant portion of its products in India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. President Trump on April 2 outlined reciprocal tariff rates from 24% to 46% on goods imported from those countries. But the administration has since delayed those duties for 90 days, so the outcome remains highly uncertain. It also means Apple is essentially sitting on its hands right now because the company has little insight into the future.\nBeyond U.S. trade policy, Apple has another problem in its misfire with Apple Intelligence, a slate of artificial intelligence features introduced last year for newer iPhone models. Many analysts expected a historic iPhone upgrade cycle to follow the launch, but that has yet to materialize. Instead, consumers seem relatively unimpressed with the AI features.\nAdditionally, what may have been the most anticipated and useful upgrade associated with Apple Intelligence -- a more sophisticated version of theconversational assistant Siri-- has been delayed due to internal issues. Some features are expected to launch in 2026, while others may not arrive until 2027, according to Bloomberg.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to grow at 11% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in September. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look somewhat expensive, especially given the uncertain nature of future U.S. trade policy. But patient investors eager to own shares can consider buying a small position today. Analysts may be overly pessimistic, in which case Apple could stage another strong rebound.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nThe recent reciprocal tariff blows on imported goods between the US and China has precipitated a substantial devaluation of Apple's market capitalisation, amounting to a $775bn loss (and counting) in the week since the 2 April 2025 announcement.\nUS President Donald Trump gave a tariff reprieve to smartphones, laptops, processors, displays, and memory chips just ten days later. However, the Trump administration downplayed the exemptions, saying that the entire consumer electronics supply chain will be reassessed during a government investigation into semiconductors, which are expected to face tariffs soon.\nIf the administration levies long-term tariffs, a wide array of consumer electronics OEMs will be impacted. This will result in increased device costs for consumers as companies pass on the additional expenses. Apple's substantial loss in market value serves as a stark indicator of the immediate repercussions. The expansion of manufacturing bases outside the US, previously a strategic move to optimise cost and efficiency, has now exposed these companies to significant levies.\nThe electronics sector, encompassing smartphones, PCs, and data center equipment, represents a significant portion of US imports. Nearly $486bn worth of electronic goods were imported in 2024, according to the US Census Bureau.\nDespite semiconductors being initially exempt from recent tariff impositions, there is an impending risk of targeted tariffs on chips, as indicated by the Trump administration. The cost of data centre infrastructure and AI chips is expected to rise, undermining the profit margins and operational efficiencies of companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, in addition to Apple, which will slow down innovation and R&D in AI.\nIn the short term, consumers might accelerate their purchases to acquire devices before the imposition of tariffs. Consequently, companies could witness a surge in profits in the near term. However, the eventual increased costs will result in a slowdown in device upgrades and further lengthen smartphone upgrade cycles in the long term. This will impact the overall sales volume, revenues, and profits for manufacturers and telcos.\nCompanies should provide clear guidance to investors in their earnings reports regarding the anticipated impact of increased import duties on customer churn and the company's financial health. Businesses will need to reassess their entire supply chains, particularly in areas such as chip fabrication and cloud infrastructure, which will take years.\n\"Tariff turmoil: consumer devices on shaky ground\" was originally created and published byVerdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\nThe Secret Formula for Faster Trains\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\nLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating trade probes led by the Commerce Department.\nThe moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president’s sweeping US trade war.\nThe Commerce Department said it had begun investigating the impact on US national security of “imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment” as well as “pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products” in a pair of register notices.\nListen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nThe probes, which began April 1 and were ordered under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could play out for months. Under the law, the Commerce Secretary is expected to deliver the results of his investigation within 270 days, though Trump and other officials have signaled these efforts could conclude more quickly.\nThe US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.\nNew levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of semiconductors essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.\nThe administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.\nThe Commerce Department investigation on semiconductors is designed to have a wide range, evaluating imports of both legacy and leading-edge chips that are coveted for artificial intelligence applications. The probe will span imports of all semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them as well as electronic products that contain the components, according to the government notice.\nTariffs on the semiconductor sector risk affecting a wide range of companies that send billions of dollars in microprocessors and related goods to the US each year. Foreign makers of advanced chips including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix of South Korea could be forced to raise prices or accept smaller margins if Trump delivers on his threat of import levies.\nThe measures also threaten to impose higher costs on Trump’s vision for expanding domestic semiconductor production, especially if imported chip-manufacturing equipment from companies like ASML Holding NV gets hit with tariffs. Netherlands-based ASML is a leading provider of advanced lithography machines used to produce the smallest computer chips used in AI and other sensitive applications.\nThe separate drug probe will examine imports of all pharmaceuticals — both finished generic and non-generic medicines — as well as the ingredients used to make them. Investigators also will probe imports of critical pharmaceutical inputs. The public is invited to weigh in on both probes with comments over the next 21 days.\nTariffs would also be a blow to the world’s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.\nAlex Schriver, spokesman for the trade group PhRMA, said in a statement that the pharmaceutical industry shares Trump’s goal of boosting US manufacturing. While he said the industry would work with the administration throughout its process, he added that “medicines have historically been excluded from tariffs because they can lead to higher costs and shortages of life-saving medicines.”\nDrug companies have raced to announce major investments in the US ahead of potential tariffs. Most recently, Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG said it plans to invest $23 billion in the US over the next five years, following earlier pledges from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson.\nBut experts warned that likely wouldn’t blunt the impact of the tariffs.\n“There is no quick fix for exposed companies, in our view,” Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note to clients ahead of the announcement. “Redomiciling manufacturing would take years and be very costly.”\nDrugmakers will face a choice between eating the costs of potential tariffs or raising prices for their medicines in what is already the most expensive market in the world.\n“There’s a lot at stake politically I think for branded manufacturers to be increasing prices here,” said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. “I do think there’s going to be reluctance to passing through price increases.”\nBecause there are some controls on the price of drugs, tariffs could end up hurting drugmakers’ bottom line, leading them to scale back research, according to Lilly Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks.\n“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,” Ricks recently told the BBC. “Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That’s a disappointing outcome.”\nTrump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers’ reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.\nWorldwide Impact\nTrump’s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he’s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper.\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.\nTrump has cast revitalizing the US chipmaking industry and industrial base as essential for the nation’s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work.\nThe move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (€47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump’s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country’s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.\nThe US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.\nNearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they’d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they’d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.\n“Re-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,” BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. “It will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.”\nTrump’s Exemptions\nThe US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.\nThe announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.\n“He’s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,” Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. “And so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‘Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,’ then he’s absolutely willing to listen.”\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the administration remained focused on negotiating deals that would benefit Americans.\n“I think we’re going to start the negotiations, and just like with everyone else, I’m telling them, bring your A-game. We’ll see what you got, and we’ll go from there,” Bessent said.\nTrump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.\n--With assistance from Michael Shepard, Annmarie Hordern, Hadriana Lowenkron and Derek Wallbank.\n(Updates with pharmaceutical industry comment in 13th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nGM’s Mary Barra Has to Make a $35 Billion EV Bet Work in Trump’s America\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n14 April 2025 - Markets justgota jolt of adrenalinethanks to Trump's surprise tariff twist. Stocks across Asia and Europe surged on Monday after the U.S. temporarily spared smartphones, semiconductors, and other consumer tech from its brutal new tariff list. The rally was swift. Hong Kong's Hang Seng soared 2.4%, Germany's DAX popped over 2%, and Dow (DIA) futures jumped 447 points. In the U.S., Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lit up the premarket screen, with Apple climbing 6.4% at 8.53pm on hopes that the iPhone wouldn't get caught in the tariff crossfireat least for now.\nBut don't get too comfortable.Trump wasted no time clarifying that the exemptions may not be permanent, it could still be reversed. He added that the spared items are simply getting moved to a different tariff bucketand could still be hit under national security reviews. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added more fuel to the fire, saying everything from semiconductors to the entire electronics supply chain is still under scrutiny. Translation? Uncertainty is back on the table. And markets know it.\nYes, last week saw one of the wildest whiplash rallies since WWIIpowered by a 90-day pause on some tariffs and a bit of short-covering magic. But underneath the euphoria, the S&P 500 is still down 5.4% from the tariff shock, and the so-called Magnificent Seven tech names are still licking their wounds. Apple alone lost $640 billion in market cap over three brutal sessions. Monday's rebound feels goodbut in this market, clarity beats relief. And right now, we've got neither.\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

The list of spared goods includes chips, solar panels, flat-screen TVs, flash drives, and memory cards.\nHowever, President Trump added that the break might not last. He suggested new tariffs on devices like iPhones and tablets could come \"very soon.\" This hinted that some tech and chip firms might still face some strain.\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump also emphasized that these products remained \"subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs\" and were merely being shifted to a different tariff category. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this sentiment, noting that the current exemptions were not permanent.\nThough when asked specifically about tariffs on iPhones, President Trump offered a somewhat imprecise response: \"There'll be maybe things coming up... I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country.\"\nDespite the unclear outlook, the market reaction suggested investors viewed the temporary exemption as a short-term relief as it was likely to provide affected companies a brief window to adjust their operations and mitigate potential impacts on their businesses.\nThe shares closed the day at $202.59, up 2.3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Apple?Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\nApple’s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 4.8% as markets rallied sharply on news that President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. Reciprocal tariffs were also dropped to 10% for most countries, sparking renewed optimism amid ongoing trade talks.\nThe major stock indices rose as investors, growing impatient of seemingly irrational tariff actions, welcomed the pause as a sign of a more measured path forward. However, Trump was quick to note that China was not part of the pause. Instead, he prepared to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US imports. This tough stance on China stood in sharp contrast to the softer tone toward others. In a week marked by growing uncertainty, this news eased some of the pressure. The questions remain whether we are out of the woods and can sustain the rally or not.\nApple is down 17.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $201.80 per share, it is trading 22.1% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,812.\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nStock markets rallied as President Donald Trump has exempted the reciprocal tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, according to a guidance issued last Friday.\nEarlier this month, Trump slapped a 145% tariff on Chinese goods — a move that put pressure on tech giants like Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing for iPhones and other devices.\n💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵\nTrump's latest move lowered that level to 20% for China-made electronic components, but it didn't rule out the prospect of steeper levies that could squeeze tech companies' profit margins.\nThe White House said the decision was meant to give companies more time to bring production back to the U.S.\nRelated: Secretary Lutnick pours cold water on tech tariff exemptions\nWhite House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said that Trump “has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.”\nTech companies like Apple benefit from the exemptions as China produces 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers, according to data from Evercore ISI.\nApple(AAPL)stock surged nearly 7.5% higher intraday before closing up 2.2% on April 14.\nEven with key electronics temporarily spared from Trump’s steep reciprocal tariffs, Apple faces other headwinds—most notably, weakening iPhone sales.\nApple’s(AAPL)share of the global smartphone market fell by one point to 18% in 2024, while Chinese Android brands Oppo, Xiaomi, and Vivo together captured 30% of the market, according to Counterpoint Research's data.\nThat weakness showed up in its most recent earnings. On Jan. 30, Apple reported record revenue and profit for the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 28, 2024, but iPhone sales lagged.\nRelated: Analysts reset Apple stock price targets amid earnings, Trump tariffs\nThe company reported record revenue of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase from a year earlier. Net income reached a record $36.33 billion, or $2.40 a diluted share, up from $33.92 billion, or $2.28, in the year-earlier period.\nApple's iPhone revenue declined nearly 1% to $69.14 billion. The iPhone remains the company's biggest sales driver, accounting for 55.6% of the revenue in the quarter.\nSales in the Greater China region, Apple's biggest overseas market, declined 11% in the December quarter due to increased competition from local brands and regulatory challenges affecting the availability of Apple Intelligence features.\nApple is set to report its earnings for the fiscal quarter ending March 2025 on May 1.\nCiti analysts led by Atif Malik lowered their stock price target for Apple to $245 from $275 following the tariff exemption. The firm maintains a buy rating on the shares.\n\"We expect AAPL stock to rally on Trump administration tariff exemptions for PCs and smartphones announced over the weekend, which blunts the negative ~900bps gross margin impact from our assessment last week,\" the analyst wrote in an April 13 research report.\nRelated: Bank of America gives eye-popping Nvidia stock forecast amid tariffs\n\"That said, Apple products are not immune from weak macro,\" the analyst warned, adding that they also lowered the estimates for iPhone shipments by 1% to align with their view of global GDP growth to contract 0.7% in 2025 under the new tariffs.\nThe firm maintained a buy rating because Apple's valuation remains attractive. It is still optimistic about a faster refreshment cycle driven by the big Siri update, which is now expected to come in 2026. Still, it is conservative about Apple’s market share in China.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nTop analyst revisits Tesla stock price target as Q1 earnings loom\nGoogle’s Waymo is planning a move that's downright creepy\nAnalyst reboots Apple stock price target after tariff meltdown\n\"We think Apple is very likely to continue to lose share in China driven by the resurgence of Huawei and anti-American sentiment, which could largely offset the growth from Apple Intelligence next year,\" the analyst wrote.\nApple stock closed at $202.52 on April 14.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nU.S. stocks edged up Monday as investors digested mixed messages on the trade war, following some of the most chaotic and turbulent weeks in recent market memory.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 added 42 points, also climbing 0.8% by market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 107 points, or 0.6%. Gold, meanwhile, slipped 0.8%, suggesting a slight pullback from last week’s mad dash into safe-haven assets. Apple (AAPL) stock climbed, helpinglead market indexes higher.\nAsurprise tariffs announcementlate Friday triggered the tech-led bounce on Monday. The electronics exemption, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, seemed to shield smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics from Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods – offering relief for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT)\nBut the reprieve may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaid Sundaythat the products are still included under a forthcoming round of semiconductor-related tariffs, “coming in probably a month or two.”\nAnd President Donald Trump later rejected the idea that there had been any exemption at all, saying the goods are still subject to existing 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs and had merely shifted tariff categories. He said no product was actually exempt, calling the change a simple reclassification.\n“NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’”Trump said Sundayon his social media site Truth Social.\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized the shifting policies as “chaos and corruption,” warning that such unpredictability is eroding investor confidence.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index isstill plantedin “extreme fear” territory, reflecting a lack of bullish sentiment amidst chaotic policy announcements — to say nothing of chaotic policy determination. The S&P 500's recent 5% intraday swings suggest volatility that is more structural than seasonal.\nAnalysts at both Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) have cut their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks, pointing to rising risks from such unpredictable policy moves and ongoing geopolitical tensions.\nHeading intoa packed week of corporate earningsin which major banks, healthcare companies, and consumer-facing platforms such as Netflix (NFLX) will report results, each release could either steady or rattle investor nerves.\nApple stock jumped 2.2% on Monday, lifted by hopes the company will be temporarily exempt from new electronics tariffs. President Trump said Monday afternoon that he was “flexible” when it came to a temporary exemption for Apple.\nSeparately, Apple reclaimed the top spot in global smartphone shipments for the first quarter 2025, thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 16e in markets such as Japan and India. Even alongside valid fears of disruptions to Apple’s supply chain, its product suite and global brand power remain unmatched.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) reported a robust 15% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, driven by strong trading performance amid market volatility. Goldman stock rose 1.9% Monday.\nBut it’s not just about one earnings beat. Goldman is a bellwether for how corporate America is handling volatility, providing a real-time pulse check on capital flows and investor sentiment in a year that’s been anything but normal.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApplehas created a loyal fan base of customers willing to pay premium prices for their products, like iPhones. The company’s strategy has long revolved around product differentiation, brand equity, and perception of value—but one longtime observer warns that a sudden jolt from large tariff-fueled price increases would deter even the most staunch Apple loyalist.\n“If someone charged you $7 for a slice of pizza, even the best slice of pizza, you wouldn’t buy it,” Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director, toldFortuneon Monday. “So everything has a price.”\nThe Trump administration announced late Friday thatsome electronics, such as smartphones, chips, and computers, were temporarily exempted from the 145% import tariffs on goods from China. The exemptions also offer relief for companies like Apple that assemble devices in China and import them. TheiPhone maker’s shareshave suffered since Trump ramped up tariffs on China.\nHowever, in asocial media poston Sunday, President Trump said, “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” while adding that the exempted products are “just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” Apple is getting some breathing room as it does not have to automatically start passing massive price increases on to U.S. consumers, Wedbush analysts wrote in a note on Sunday evening. But there’s still caution ahead.\n“If the 145% China tariffs came into play we believe Apple would have no choice but to start charging $2,000-plus for iPhone Pro once inventory levels came down,” the analysts wrote.\nMeanwhile, amid ongoing tariff uncertainty, many Apple customers are flocking to stores to make purchases before any potential price bumps. Apple employees from locations across the U.S. saidstores were filled with customersthe weekend following Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs. Apple’s retail stores in the U.S. saw higher sales that weekend than in prior years in at least some major markets, Bloomberg reported.\nThe “panic buying” is also about the other bucket of tariffs that could come over the next few months, Ives toldFortune. “When you create that level of uncertainty, it causes chaos in the supply chain,” he said.\nApple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in Q1 on the back of the iPhone 16e’s launch and strong demand, data from Counterpoint Research showed,according to Reuters. And a survey from International Data Corporation found global smartphone shipments rose 1.5% in the first quarter, with Apple front-loading supply to sidestep potential tariffs.\nApple investors need to look past the next three months and “assume China tariff negotiations take a positive turn,” Wedbush analysts wrote in Sunday’s note. The firm maintains an outperform rating and a $250 price target.\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com",

KeyBanc upgraded the iPhone maker's stock to a neutral “sector weight” rating from “underweight.\"\nCiti analysts said they expect Apple's stock to get a boost from the tech tariff exemptions, but warned Apple's products “are not immune” to a weak macro environment. The bank kept its “outperform” rating for Apple, but lowered its sales estimates for iPhones, Macs, and Apple wearable devices, given its projection of a contraction in globalgross domestic productthis year under new tariffs.\nThe tariff exemptions could also prove temporary, after Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnick saidSunday that the administration plans to impose new tariffs within a couple months.\nWedbush, which holds an “outperform” rating for Apple stock, said the exemption window “gives some flexibility and allows for China negotiations to hopefully take place in the coming months which could deescalate some tariff\/trade war issues with Big Tech caught in the middle.”\nShares of Apple rose about 2% to close at $202.52 Monday, extending Friday's gains.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer suggested the recent tariffs might not simply be about economic leverage. He hinted at a deeper agenda within parts of the administration that goes beyond trade policy:\n“There’s plenty of sense that something’s going to happen that’s going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don’t see that at all. I think these are very different kinds of tariffs. I mean, this is a tariff where I think there’s some people with the administration who actually ultimately have a goal of regime change.“\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Reacts to the Surprise Market Surge and Highlights 8 Key StocksandJim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key Stocks\nDiscussing the likelihood of a negotiated settlement between Washington and Beijing, Cramer expressed deep skepticism that China would retreat under pressure. Instead, he described a Chinese leadership that had long prepared for confrontation:\n“When do the Chinese back down? Right now they’re not, but I don’t know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they’re going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they’re paper tigers. I think that they’re a strong country and they’re ready. They’re ready for the fight. And I’m afraid that we have many divisions that were behind enemy lines before this war started, including Apple.”\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 11th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nOnce again, Cramer expressed deep concern over Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), calling attention to the company’s vulnerability in China. He framed Apple not only as a target of tariffs but as collateral damage in a broader geopolitical battle between the U.S. and China. He repeatedly questioned why American companies like Apple were being punished while foreign competitors like Huawei and Samsung stood to benefit. Here are his remarks:\n“And I think that one of the things that’s happening is that people are just saying, look, it’s too crazy. I mean, Apple was up. Now, I could argue that Apple shouldn’t have ever been up, but Apple’s come down. There’s a sense that, like, OK, this thing may be for real. And if it’s real, then how can you own Apple? Why not go buy Samsung?\nOverall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nConfusion over President Donald Trump’s tariffs remains following a weekend of questions around trade in consumer electronics.\nOn Friday the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops. But these goods remain subject to other levies.\nAnd officials have also indicated that additional, sector-specific tariffs targeting electronics are on the way — all of which economists warn will raise costs and lead to higher prices for consumers.\nHere's what we know.\nAre electronics exempt from Trump's newest tariffs?\nLate Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, would be excluded from broader, so-called“reciprocal” tariffs— meaning these goods wouldn't be subject tomost tariffs levied on Chinato date or the10% baseline leviesimposed on other countries.\nBut U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said that this was only a temporary reprieve — telling ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that electronics will be included under future sector-specific tariffs on semiconductor products, set to arrive in \"probably a month or two.”\nAnd not all of the levies that the U.S. has imposed on countries like China fall under the White House's “reciprocal” categorization. Hours after Lutnick's comments, Trump declared on social media that there was no “exception” at all, adding to confusion. Trump instead argued that these goods are “just moving to a different” bucket. He also said that China will still face a 20% levy on electronics imports as part of his administration’s prior move related to fentanyl trafficking.\nHow has China responded?\nOn Sunday, China’s commerce ministry welcomed a partial reprieve on consumer electronics — but continued to call for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs.\nChinese President Xi Jinpingreiterated that on Monday, writing in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media that \"there are no winners in a trade war.” He added that both China and the U.S. “should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.”\nTit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have escalated to new heights over recent months. Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed a series of levies that now amount to 145% taxes on a range of imports from the country.\nIn response, China has hit back with its own measures, including tariffs on U.S. goods that currently total 125%. Its Commerce Ministryhas also saidit will impose more export controls on rare earths, used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.\nWhat could reducing tariffs on electronics mean for consumers?\nTariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. And because so many of the electronics we buy rely on a global supply chain, economists have warned that tariffs impacting consumer technology could mean higher prices for your next smartphone, computer or other gadgets.\nReducing the size of those tariffs, even temporarily, could delay or lessen that impact. But it's unlikely that price hikes will be totally avoided. Electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-\"reciprocal”) tariffs — and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies down the road.\nIt would also be incredibly difficult for companies to change their supply chains. The Trump administration argues that tariffs will entice big names like Apple, for example, to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But Apple has spent decadesbuilding up a finely calibrated supply chain in China— and it would take years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S.\nWendong Zhang, an assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University, says the tariffs' impact on consumer tech reflects how difficult a “full decoupling between U.S. and China” is. Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make themaccounted for nearly $174 billionin U.S. imports from China last year.\nTrump signaled on Monday that hehad spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cookbefore exempting electronics from some of his China tariffs — telling reporters that he had “helped” Cook with the partial reprieve, while separately saying he plans to providetemporary exemptions for auto makersthat may also need “a little bit of time.” Apple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for statement.\nHow is Wall Street reacting?\nTariffs have plunged financial markets worldwide into turmoil — particularly battering stocks following of Trump's sweeping announcement on April 2. That cooled after news of this partial electronics exemption, as well as last week's pause of steeper tariffs outside of China.\nOn Monday,the S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%.\nStill, the relief could be fleeting. While the partial electronics reprieve indicates that Trump is watching markets, Zhang notes, it and other looming actions also show that the administration’s “tariff strategy is a lot more about the leverage and signaling ... as opposed to coherent long term trade framework.”\nOverall, uncertainty remains high — making it hard for many companies trying to solidify long-term plans when conditions seem to change daily.\n“Businesses thrive on stability because they plan around rules of engagement ... Ergo, markets perform better when businesses are confident that the rules are really the rules,” Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, wrote in a Monday note. Still, he added, businesses will need to avoid knee-jerk reactions while evaluating risk. “When Friday’s policies are thrown out with Sunday’s brunch leftovers, companies will resort to one primary strategy: do as little as possible and thereby do no harm.”\n_______\nAP Writers Josh Boak in Washington, Mae Anderson in Nashville, Tennessee and Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nWith new tariffs being imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese goods at the beginning of April,Apple IncAAPL andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA saw their stocks decline. However, the latest tariff relief has been a blessing in disguise for these tech behemoths, helping them prevent higher import costs and product price rises. This has prompted speculation on which stock to invest in. Let’s explore –\nPresident Trump’s steep tariffs on goods produced and imported from China could have disrupted Apple’s supply chains as severely as during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Apple breathed a sigh of relief after the Trump administration exempted electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs.\nBefore the tariff exemption, Apple planned to increase iPhone production in India, which is subject to lower levies, while also securing its supply chain. Apple intends to produce over 30 million iPhones in India, satisfying a significant portion of American demand, which constitutes a third of global demand.\nHowever, Apple is manufacturing its upcoming iPhone 17 in China, which will be launched soon. Shifting the production base to India or another location in a short time will require a herculean effort. It may also lead to retaliation from China, which has set up inquiries into U.S. companies and may create difficulties for Apple through its customs processes.\nA complete breakup from China would be improbable as Apple produces the bulk of its iPhones in China, and there is a dearth of required skills to manufacture iPhones in the United States at the moment. Instead, Apple argued that the United States should boost semiconductor production and revive high-value job opportunities.\nHowever, the tariff relief is temporary, and if no breakthrough occurs soon, it may impact Apple’s near-term profitability. President Trump said that relying on China for vital tech goods like smartphones and semiconductors isn’t acceptable. If tariffs are imposed, iPhone prices will rise, impacting American consumers and Apple’s sales volume. Anyhow, some tariffs still apply to goods imported from China and there may be sectoral tariffs on goods that have semiconductors, which can further affect Apple’s stagnating revenues.\nGiven the supply-chain risks, stagnant revenues and tariff uncertainties, Apple isn’t a favorable stock choice currently. Moreover, according to the price\/earnings (P\/E) ratio, Apple stock trades at 27.4X forward earnings. In comparison, the Computer - Micro Computers industry’s forward earnings multiple is 26.05. The Apple stock, therefore, is overvalued and may plummet if tariff issues remain unresolved.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLike Apple, NVIDIA too got a momentary relief from Trump’s tariffs. This is because certain critical chips used by NVIDIA and produced in China were exempted. Now, there is a 90-day pause in tariffs, but the outcome depends on how the negotiations between the United States and its trade partners unfold. So, an element of ambiguity persists.\nHowever, NVIDIA remains the preferred stock to buy during these times of distress. With graphic processing units (GPUs) continuing to gain popularity at a breakneck speed and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending increasing, NVIDIA’s long-term future looks brighter. Lest we forget, Apple faces tough competition across all segments, economic challenges, and regulatory hazards, affecting its long-term outlook.\nComing back to NVIDIA, the company is experiencing high demand for new Blackwell and older Hopper chips because of their superior AI interfaces compared to competitors. The company’s CUDA software platform is in more demand among developers thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform. Major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN andAlphabet Inc.GOOGL  are also spending billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure, which could benefit NVIDIA (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy?).\nNVIDIA stock is currently more affordable than its competitors, with a forward P\/E ratio of 25.18 compared to the Semiconductor - General industry’s 28.4X forward earnings multiple. This leads to NVIDIA having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, whereas Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has managed to dodge a potential disaster as its key consumer electronics have been exempted from the 125% tariffs on goods manufactured in China by PresidentDonald Trump.\nWhat Happened: The tariff exemption announced by President Trump on Friday night encompasses iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirTags. Furthermore, the 10% tariff on goods imported from other countries has been waived off for these products.\nDespite the possibility of a new, lower sectoral tariff being imposed on goods containing semiconductors, and a 20% tariff on China still in place, this development signifies a major triumph for Apple and the consumer electronics industry that is heavily dependent on China for production, reports Bloomberg.\nDon’t Miss:‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.You can invest today for just $0.26\/share with a $1000 minimum.\nAmit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI, expressed his relief for Apple in a note on Saturday, stating, “The tariffs would have driven material cost inflation.” He predicts a surge in Apple’s shares on Monday following an 11% plunge this month.\nPrior to the recent exemption, Apple had devised a plan to shift its supply chain to manufacture more US-bound iPhones in India, which would have been subject to much lower levies.\nThis strategy was viewed as a short-term solution to evade the high China tariff and avert significant price increases.\nNevertheless, uncertainty prevails as White House policies are prone to change, and Apple may need to implement more drastic alterations. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has described the move as “a small step by the US toward correcting its wrongful action of unilateral ‘reciprocal tariffs’,” and has called on the US to completely rescind the action.\nSee Also:Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\nHoward Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, indicated on ABC outlet that the late Friday reprieve was temporary, and reiterated Trump's plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector.\nWhy It Matters:The tariff exemption is a significant development for Apple, which heavily relies on China for manufacturing its products. The move could potentially save the company from significant cost inflation, as noted by Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani.\nHowever, the uncertainty surrounding White House policies and the temporary nature of the reprieve means that Apple may still need to consider alternative strategies, such as shifting more of its manufacturing to countries like India.\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the US and China also add an element of unpredictability to the situation.\nRead Next:\nHow do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nImage: Shutterstock\nSend To MSN:  Send to MSN\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.Click now to access unique insightsthat can set you ahead in today's competitive market.\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis articleApple Escapes Supply Chain Crisis As Trump Excludes Popular Electronics From Tariffsoriginally appeared onBenzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nFollow the latest on Trump’s tariff war\nDonald Trump has vowed to hit imports of pharmaceuticals with new tariffs in a major setback for one of Britain’s largest export industries.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office on Monday night, the US President said he would announce the charges on foreign drugs in the “not too distant future”.\nIt would mark a landmark moment for the industry, which has been exempt from tariffs for decades, following a World Trade Organisation agreement to ensure countries can get affordable access to medicines.\nIt is also a key export market for nations including the UK and Ireland. Pharmaceuticals is Britain’s second largest industry for exports to the US, after cars.\nMr Trump said: “We don’t make our own drugs, our own pharmaceuticals - we don’t make our own drugs any more.\n“The drug companiesare in Ireland, in lots of other places [like] China. And all I have to do is impose a tariff. The more, the faster they move here.”\nMr Trump also suggested he was exploring possible tariff exemptions for imported vehicles to give carmakers “a little bit of time” to move manufacturing to the US.\nPharmaceuticals were excluded from the first round of sweeping tariffs announced on Mr Trump’s “liberation day” earlier this month. However, he has hinted they will be subject to industry-specific charges, much like those levied on car and steel imports.\nOn Monday, he renewed his pledge, saying: “We’re going to be doing that. That’s going to be like we have on cars, you know a 25pc tariff on cars. We have a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminium. And that’s what that category fits right now.”\nLast week, the chairman of British drugmaker AstraZeneca said medicines “should be exempted from any kind of tariffs because at the end this is just harming patients, health systems and restricting health equity”.\nAround £7.2bn worth of medicines and pharmaceutical products was exported from the UK to the US in the 12 months to November, compared to around £4.5bn imported from the US to the UK.\nThe US imports around $213bn (£163bn) worth of pharmaceuticals every year and is reliant on countries such as India for supply of low-cost “generic” medicines.\nGenerics - mass-produced drugs that do not carry a patent - account for around 90pc of all US prescriptions, while India supplies almost half of all US generic medicines. Drug companies have warned that it would be more expensive to produce these medicines in the US, raising the risk of price increases for patients.\nMr Trump has claimed new tariffs will make drugmakers “come rushing back into our country because we are the big market”. He said earlier this month: “The advantages we have over everybody is that we’re the big market.”\nThe US President has been particularly critical of companies with manufacturing in low-tax jurisdictions including Ireland.Last month, Mr Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, said: “We’re gonna try to fix a whole bunch of these tax scams. Ireland is my favourite.”\nIreland’s enterprise minister swiftly rejected the characterisation: “We absolutely have no tax scams in this country.”\nThe threat of new tariffs risks having ripple effects for some of Britain’s largest listed companies. AstraZeneca makes around 42pc of its sales in the US, according to AJ Bell analysis of Bloomberg data, while GSK makes around 52pc. AstraZeneca has around 22pc of its manufacturing facilities there, while GSK has 26pc.\nMr Trump’s comments on Monday caused Wall Street to plunge briefly into negative territory as traders attempted to parse the financial hit that the move would make. The key stock market index, the S&P 500, is up by 0.9pc.\nIt came as Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, admitted that tariffs at their current level against Chinese imports were not sustainable.\nHe said that he still had hope for a major trade deal with Beijing, which has labelled the tariffs a “joke”.\n“These are not a joke. I mean these are big numbers,” Mr Bessent said. “I think no one thinks they’re sustainable, wants them to remain here, but it’s far from a joke.”\nHe told Bloomberg Television that trade talks had begun with Vietnam and were due to start with Japan on Wednesday, followed by South Korea next week.\nRead the latest updates below.\nThanks for joining us today on this live blog.\nYou canfollow all our latest stories and commentary on the world of business and economics here.\nLesotho has granted a licence to Elon Musk’s Starlink to satellite internet services, the country’s communications authority has said.\nThe licence granted to Starlink Lesotho will be valid for 10 years, Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) said .\nThe development comes as Lesotho seeks to engage with the United States on reciprocal trade tariffs after it was hit with a 50pc tariff - the highest levy on Donald Trump’s list of target economies announced earlier this month. The tariff has since been temporarily lowered.\nThe LCA said the “landmark decision” to grant a licence to Starlink marked “a significant step forward in the country’s digital transformation” and that it underscored “the authority’s unwavering commitment to enabling a competitive, transparent, and forward-looking communications sector that fuels economic growth and fosters innovation”.\nIn March, Mr Trump described Lesotho as a country “no one has heard of”. Lesotho’s foreign minister, Lejone Mpotjoane, later said the remark was “quite insulting”.\nStarlink, whose parent company is SpaceX, submitted its licence application in April 2024 but it faced opposition including from campaigners.\nKananelo Boloetse, an activist based in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, said: “By proceeding with this decision, the LCA has not only disregarded the valid objections of local stakeholders but has also compromised the integrity and credibility of the regulatory process”.\n“Chief among these [objections] was the fact that Starlink Lesotho is 100pc foreign-owned, a factor that should have weighed heavily in a licencing process that ought to safeguard national interests and promote inclusive local participation.”\nStarlink operates in many African countries, but has faced licencing obstacles in places such as South Africa and Namibia.\nThe world’s largest luxury goods group has revealed that its sales fell 3pc in the first three months of the year, as shoppers held back on purchases of designer goods in a choppy economic environment.\nLVMH’s update sent its US shares down 7.5pc.\nThe French company behind high-end labels including fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, jewellery brand Bulgari and Hennessy cognac, has had a “difficult start” to the year, said Bernstein analysts.\nEurope’s luxury players were counting on wealthy Americans to reignite growth for the sector at the start of this year as the outlook for China, another crucial market, remained bleak.\nBut with fears of a US recession on the rise after Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcements sent stock markets and the dollar plunging, the sector is bracing for what could be its longest slump in years.\nThe fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and Dior and accounting for nearly half of group sales and over three quarters of operating profit, posted a 5pc fall in sales, well below expectations for a flat performance.\nSales in the US market fell 3pc in the first quarter, while in the Asia region, excluding Japan, they were down 11pc. Total group sales for the three months to the end of March came to €20.3bn (£17.5bn).\nThe luxury sector, selling prized items to rich shoppers at high margins, is better positioned than other industries to use its pricing power to shield profits against Mr Trump’s tariffs, which would include a 20pc charge on European fashion and leather goods and 31pc for Swiss-produced watches, if fully applied.\nLast week, Mr Trump paused most of his tariffs for 90 days, setting a general 10pc duty rate instead.\nWall Street edged slightly higher this afternoon after the White House created exemptions from his tariffs.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.2pc and the S&P 500 gained 0.3pc. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2pc, boosted by technology shares including Apple, whose stock gained around 2.4pc.\nThe S&P 500 rallied 5.7pc last week, but was still more than 5pc below where it was before what Trump calls “reciprocal” tariffs were first announced in early April.\nUK shares climbed on Monday in broad-based gains after Donald Trump exempted smartphones and computers from steep Chinese tariffs, offering investors some relief following weeks of market volatility.\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 2.1pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index gained 2.5pc.\nThe White House unveiled the tariff exemptions on Friday covering 20 categories including smartphones and laptops, as well as semiconductor memory chips and flat panel displays, accounting for 23pc of US imports from China.\nBut Mr Trump on Sunday declared these exemptions temporary and revealed plans to announce new semiconductor tariffs within a week, with smartphone tariffs to follow “soon”.\nPersistent uncertainty surrounding tariff policies has disrupted global markets recently, leading to a roughly 8pc drop in the UK’s blue-chip index from its record-closing high.\nDonald Trump is considering exemptions to his tariffs on imported cars and auto parts to give US manufacturers some breathing space while they build new plants.\nHe told reporters in the Oval Office: “I’m looking at something to help car companies with it.\n“They’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places, and they need a little bit of time, because they’re going to make them here.”\nShares in several US-listed carmakers surged after the comments. General Motors rose 3.7pc, Stellantis added 2.4pc and Ford rose 2.9pc.\nDonald Trump has said that China and Vietnam were meeting to figure out how to harm the United States, but that he did not blame them for such discussions.\nThe US president told reporters in the Oval Office: “I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam.\n“I see they’re meeting today... that’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, ‘how do we screw the United States of America’.”\nEuropean shares closed higher today, after Donald Trump exempted smartphones and computers, bringing some respite after weeks of turmoil.\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 ended 2.7pc higher after registering its third consecutive week in the red on Friday.\nThe top index in Germany rose 2.9pc, while France, Spain, and Britain also registered gains of more than 2pc.\nWeeks of back-and-forth over tariffs have rattled global markets, dragging the benchmark Stoxx 600 index down roughly 11pc from its record closing high.\nBanks and chip-related companies were among the biggest risers.\nDarrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said: “The problem markets are wresting with today, in our view, is the Trump administration has conflicting priorities and difficult time-horizon mismatches between geopolitical ambitions and economic and market outcomes.”\nDespite Monday’s gains, the benchmark index sits almost 7pc away from levels seen before Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs were announced on April 2.\nDonald Trump has claimed to have already fixed inflation, despite warnings from economists that tariffs will fuel higher prices.\n“We already solved inflation,” Mr Trump told reporters gathered Monday in the Oval Office.\nThe US president was touting the 2.4pc annual inflation rate seen in the latest data released published today.\nDonald Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on drugs shortly as he steps up his push to move manufacturing to the US.\nHe told reporters in the Oval Office: “Pharmaceuticals we’re going to do. We don’t make our own drugs, our own pharmaceuticals - we don’t make our own drugs any more. The drug companies are in Ireland, in lots of other places [like] China. And all I have to do is impose a tariff. The more, the faster they move here.\n“We’re going to be doing that. That’s going to be like we have on cars, you know a 25pc tariff on cars. We have a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminium. And that’s what that category fits right now.\n“I have a timeline - not too distant future.”\nDonald Trump has taken credit for a rising stock market.\nHe told a press conference in the Oval Office: “The numbers are incredible, actually. Stock market’s up. We’re not letting other countries take advantage of this country like they have for the last 40 years.”\nThe S&P 50 is up 2.4pc over the past five trading days and down 8.7pc since the start of the year.\nGoldman Sachs’ trading floor has posted its best quarterly performance ever in the first three months of 2025 after successfully capitalising on the volatility in global markets that has followed Donald Trump’s return to the White House.The investment bank reported a 27pc year-on-year increase in revenues from its stock trading division to record highs of $4.9bn (£3.7bn) in the quarter of 2025, even as all of the major US stock indices have seen their values drop since the start of the year.Goldman’s bumper trading performance came as David Solomon, the bank’s chief executive, said “the prospect of a recession has increased” as a result of the US president’s decision to impose tariffs on every country in the world.The bank boss said “growth was slowing down” before Trump put in place his trade policies on 2nd April as he suggested the “uncertainty” surrounding his tariffs would make the situation worse. “The level of uncertainty is up significantly,” Mr Solomon said.Trump’s tariff announcements drove wild fluctuations in stock markets worldwide that saw some of sharpest drops in major indexes since the start of Covid, when the global economic activity ground to a halt due to lockdowns across the globe.\nThe EU’sretaliatory tariffs on US goods worth €21.9bn (£18.7bn)will be on hold until July 14, Brussels has said, to give time for negotiations with Washington.\nThe European Union was hit with a 20pc rate as part of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on April 2, before he suspended the measures for 90 days a week later.\nTo give breathing room for negotiations, the EU in turn last week halted its countermeasures on previously enacted US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and on the auto sector - which remain in place.\nThe EU’s pause will “take legal effect” on Tuesday, the European Commission said.\nEU trade chief Maros Sefcovic is in Washington today for talks with US counterparts in the hope of an agreement before the 90 days are over.\nThe EU is still preparing its response to the 20pc levies, it said, although Brussels has made it clear it would prefer to avoid retaliation.\n“The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, risking economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the Commission said.\nDonald Trump’s policies will be “very good” for share prices, a White House economic adviser has claimed,writesMax Head.\nKevin Hassett said that future tax cuts, deregulation and cutting red tape would be “very good for the country and equities market”.\nHe added: “I don’t see how the long run, a year from now, the policies that we’re looking at are viewed as anything other than a big positive for equity markets.”\nThis comes amid uncertainty over President Trump’s tariffs policies, which caused Wall Street to plunge last week.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley warned that Mr Trump’s trade war is still likely to exacerbate uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\n“The equity market will likely remain in a wide trading range with high volatility until we have more certainty on the depth of the growth slowdown and the timing of a recovery,” they wrote.\nXi Jinping, the Chinese president, has said that China and Vietnam should “jointly oppose unilateral bullying”, as he made a state visit to the Southeast Asian nation in the shadow of US tariffs.\n“We must strengthen strategic resolve, jointly oppose unilateral bullying, and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,” Mr Xi told Vietnam’s top leader, To Lam, according to the Xinhua news agency.\nChina and Vietnam have reportedly signed 45 cooperation agreements today. According to Xinhua, the the deals cover a wide range of sectors including artificial intelligence, customs inspection and quarantine, and agricultural products trade.\nNvidia is to build AI supercomputers in the US for the first time as Donald Trump’s trade war upends global supply chains.\nThe tech giant said that it has commissioned a million square feet of new factories to make the machines.\nTogether, its US manufacturing of AI chips and supercomputers would “create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades”.\nJensen Huang, chief executive, said: “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.”\nThe White House said: “It’s the Trump Effect in action.”\nWall Street jumped on Monday after the US exempted smartphones, laptops and other electronic products import tariffs,writesJulia Amann.\nThe move spared the sector most of the 145pc tariffs Mr Trump has imposed on China.\nDow Jones was up 1.3pc, while Nasdaq rose 1.9pc and the S&P 500 added 1.7pc.\nThe exemptions will ease some pressures on the cost of consumer goods, notably on Apple products, which would have become “unsellable” if tariffs went into effect, according to Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\nHe said: “It feels as if the Trump administration is responding to consumer pressure... the huge tariffs placed on China might be walked back as well.”\nTech firms were among the biggest risers in the S&P. Dell, which manufactures extensively in China, rose 7pc. Apple is up 3.7pc, while Nvidia rose 1.5pc, after chipmakers were also exempted from the duties.\nWall Street’s “fear gauge”, officially called the Vix, fell from eight-month highs hit last week and is down 17.3pc today.\nThe dollar turned higher this afternoon after a bruising week as investors became increasingly worried about Donald Trump’s erratic implementation of tariffs\nIt is still down 0.7pc against the pound today, and down 5.43pc this year.\nAdam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive: “The policy-making is so chaotic that it’s tough to think beyond the next 24 hours in terms of where the policy rates might be or where the economy is headed.\n“The uncertainty is now at an intolerable level for most businesses in international trade and the question is how quickly that hits the consumer in the real economy. Right now, the market is taking a dim view on future US growth and that has come through most clearly in the currency market.”\nNick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe, said: “Markets right now are trading the uncertainty, and that has not been helped over the weekend by the contradictory stories coming out of the US administration.\n“That really skews risks for the time being towards further dollar weakness as markets try to avoid some of this uncertainty by hiding basically anywhere that isn’t in the US.”\nThe US dollar index, which compares the American currency with a basket of leading rivals, is currently down 0.3pc today, but was down as low as 0.9pc earlier.\nXi Jinping signed dozens of agreements with leaders in Vietnam at the start of a tour of Southeast Asia as Donald Trump’s tariffs disrupt US economic relations in the region.\nThe deals included enhancing supply chains and cooperation over railways, although detailed content was not disclosed.\nOn Saturday Vietnam’s deputy prime minister Bui Thanh Son had said around 40 agreements would be signed.

How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession.”\nMr Dalio said the “breaking down” of the global monetary system and “profound changes” in the way that America is ruled have now put the world on course for a “very severe” situation, that could be worse than either the 2008 crash or the Nixon shock in 1971.\nThe New York born billionaire, who previously predicted the 2008 recession, added that the situation the world’s currently facing is “very much like the 1930s”. He added: “Right now we’re at a juncture.”\nMr Dalio said that the worst-case scenario could see a global economic “downturn” paired with political clashes inside America and “international conflict” between countries worldwide.\nHe said: “To be very specific, the value of money, internal conflict that is not the normal democracy as we know it, and international conflict in a way that is highly disruptive to the world economy and could even be a military conflict just as these breakdowns have occurred before.”\nMr Dalio said Trump’s tariffs risk making the situation worse, as he suggested the US president risks approaching America’s problems in a “chaotic and disruptive way”.\nThe 75-year-old hedge fund manager said America now has an opportunity to avoid the most “severe” situation, by resolving the issues currently faced in a “practical” and “stable” way.\nTo do so, Mr Dalio said the US must cut its deficit and work with other countries in an “orderly way” to avoid “great disruptions.” He said: “It can be done in a bipartisan way the way it was done between 1991 and ‘98.”\nStocks have jumped after the “partial de-escalation” of US tariffs by Donald Trump against

in France and Germany were up 2pc.\nPaul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said there were some big winners in Asia from the exemptions, which apply to 20 product types.\nHe said: “At a stroke, 64pc of US imports from Taiwan are now exempt from the 10pc reciprocal tariff, 44pc from Malaysia, and almost 30pc from both Vietnam and Thailand. 10pc to 12pc of imports from India, Korea and Mexico will also now be exempt.\n“The upshot is that the overall effective tariff rate on US imports now stands at 22pc, still up a lot from 2.3pc last year, but down from 27pc [on Thursday].\n“The increase in the headline tariff rate on China specifically remains at 145pc, but the effective increase once those exemptions are accounted for is now closer to 106pc.”\nHe added: “These exemptions will presumably not be the last either, with the success of Apple’s Tim Cook in getting its smartphones exempted likely to boost the lobbying by firms in other sectors.”\nEuropean stock markets rose sharply at the open after the United States announced exemptions from sweeping tariffs for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products.\nThe Dax in Frankfurt and Cac 40 in Paris jumped 1.8pc, tracking gains in Asia and on Wall Street, despite Donald Trump warning that the exemptions could be short-lived.\nThe cost of

trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.\nChina’s exports jumped as companies rushed to beat increases in US tariffs, Beijing said.\nExports rose 12.4pc in

imports.\n“As a result, it’s likely that direct trade between the US and China will crater starting in April.”\nJP Morgan economists warned Donald Trump’s recentscaling back of his tariffsstill left the US likely to face a recession.\nBruce Kasman, head of economics at the Wall Street bank, said: “The post-liberation day back-pedalling has led some to breathe a sigh of relief. Not us.\n“A 10pc universal tax is still a very large shock and the huge 145pc tax on China is prohibitive.\n“You cannot stop trade between the world’s two largest economies and not expect damage everywhere. We maintain our call for a 60pc likelihood of a US\/global recession.”\nEuropean stocks were higher in premarket trading as Donald Trump exempted consumer electronics like laptops and smartphones from US tariffs.\nAsian markets had already moved higher after the White House exempted smartphones and computers from “reciprocal” US tariffs.\nHowever, gains were limited as the President warned levies were still likely at some point.\nIndeed, Mr Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made “soon”.\nThe dollar fell for a fifth consecutive day over concerns the US is heading for a recession.\nThe pound gained 0.2pc to $1.311 while the euro rose 0.1pc to 1.137.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nInvesting.com -- Apple may be able to weather near-term tariff headwinds from rising U.S.-China trade tensions, and while relocating iPhone manufacturing to the United States is not imminent, it could be \"conceptually possible,\" Bank of America said.\nThe U.S. announced a temporary reprieve from new 125% reciprocal tariffs for consumer electronics, sparing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for now.Electronic imports from China remain at the previous 20% rate, but this is expected to be short-lived. Officials signaled that electronics, semiconductors, and solar cells may still be included in upcoming sector-specific tariffs.\nBofA refreshed its tariff impact analysis for Apple, assuming a 20% tariff on Chinese-made electronics and no tariffs on Indian exports.Under this scenario, the hit to Apple’s earnings per share in calendar 2026 could be about $0.41, or a 4.9% drop, if the company absorbs all costs and keeps prices unchanged. That compares to a previously estimated 36.6% earnings hit under steeper tariffs.\nIf Apple were to raise U.S. prices by around 10%, the EPS impact would shrink to just $0.11, or 1.2%, even accounting for a projected 5% drop in units sold, the bank said.\nApple is already producing some iPhones in India, with about 15 million units expected to be exported to the U.S. tariff-free.However, the remaining 35 million iPhones as well as all iPads and Macs sold in the U.S. would face the 20% tariff if they continue to be made in China.\nWhile the risk of a broader trade war still looms, BofA noted Apple could take several steps to soften the blow, such as raising prices, adjusting supply chains, lobbying for exceptions, or slowing its product release cycle.\nAs for shifting iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., BofA estimates it would cost about 25% more than producing in China, mostly due to higher labor costs. But increased automation and less frequent product launches could reduce that burden over time\nDespite the uncertainty, BofA reiterated its Buy rating on Apple, citing resilient margins, strong cash flows, and steady capital returns. The price objective remains $250.\nRelated articles\nHigh Global Debt Is Making Rate Hikes Trickier, BIS’s Borio Says\nProthena Corp PT Raised to $80 at BofA Securities\nEtsy PT Raised to $145 at BofA Securities",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s tariff exclusions for smartphones and other tech products have added to a growing set of confusing signals for companies and trading partners digesting how to engage a White House still promising to negotiate dozens of new deals in America’s favor.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\nThe Secret Formula for Faster Trains\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\nLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage\nThe dizzying weekend saw Trump exclude popular consumer electronics from 125% tariffs on China and a 10% baseline global tariff. The move exempted more than $101 billion in US imports from China alone and was seen as a short-term win for US tech champions like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\nTrump and top aides on Sunday, though, declared that the reprieve was only a procedural maneuver to ultimately hit those tech products with a different, sector-specific tariff.\nSupply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here.\nThen on Monday, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he was “looking at something to help car companies” as they worked to set up manufacturing facilities in the US, ahead of a May 3 tariff deadline on parts.\nFor financial markets handicapping the economic spillovers, that again made finding clarity hard in a strategy the White House insists is carefully constructed but critics see as subject to the whims of a transactional president. An early stock rally on Monday lost momentum and Treasuries extended gains as volatility persisted after seven sessions of big Wall Street swings. Most megacaps fell as the Nasdaq 100 briefly erased what had been a 2.2% jump.\nFor countries sending delegations to Washington to negotiate — like the European Union’s trade chief is aiming to do Monday — fresh questions arose about whether talking is even the best approach.\nAnd for international companies operating in an environment where rules can change overnight, inactivity during the turmoil is emerging as the safest bet.\n‘Act First’\n“The Trump team continues to follow an approach of act first, then make adjustments as needed,” said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This approach contributes to more unpredictability for investors and our trading partners, who may no longer conclude that rushing to negotiate with the US is the best approach.”\nTrump is hailing a flurry of negotiations aimed at locking in reduced country-by-country tariffs, which he has long said he won’t apply to sectors that have their own levies.\nSuch duties have already been rolled out for autos, steel, and aluminum. More national security investigations that would lead to tariffs are expected in the weeks ahead on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other vital sectors.\n“We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,” Trump said in a social media post Sunday. “What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”\nChina’s government said the US decision to exempt certain consumer electronics was a small step and called for abolishing tariffs altogether. President Xi Jinping is heading to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week to shore up relationships in the region.\nIn Washington, the frenetic weekend shifts further muddy the water — even if Trump’s administration had long flagged some of them. While Trump has indicated he will haggle over country rates, questions are now emerging over whether the sectoral tariffs are up for bargaining as well.\n“Those are not available for negotiation,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC’s “This Week.”\nHours later, however, Trump signaled an openness to talks with companies over the scope of his semiconductor tariffs. “We’ll be discussing it, but we’ll also talk to companies,” he told reporters on the plane flying back from Florida. “You have to show a certain flexibility.”\nFueling Inactivity\nThe White House’s messaging is creating more uncertainty for companies dependent on imports to the US.\nDetroit’s Big Three automakers for weeks have lobbied the Trump administration to exclude certain low-cost car components from planned tariffs.\nGeneral Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV have conceded they’re willing to pay tariffs on completed cars and large components like engines and transmissions, but company representatives have told the administration that broad parts duties would drive up costs by billions of dollars and trigger profit warnings and layoffs that would counter Trump’s goal of rebuilding US auto manufacturing.\n“The whole system seems designed to create paralysis,” Ryan Petersen, the founder and CEO of digital freight platform Flexport Inc., wrote in a social media post Sunday.\nExplainer: What Is Trump Actually Trying to Do With Tariffs?\nTobias Meyer, chief executive officer of cargo and logistics giant DHL Group, said companies trying to conform with constantly shifting US directives “don’t know even if something’s announced, whether two days later it’s not changed again.”\n“You really see some fatigue of decision makers in manufacturing and also in the distribution sector,” Meyer said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “I hear a lot that customers simply say, ‘we’ll wait for now.’”\nThe economic fallout of such a freezing up of trade could be wide. On Monday, Singapore’s trade ministry downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year, saying businesses and consumers may “adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach before making spending decisions.”\nDiplomats and other officials who’ve sought to engage in talks with the US are similarly unsure about how best to proceed.\nBond Market Signals\nIn the wake of Trump’s April 2 unveiling of his new tariffs, senior administration officials publicly insisted there wouldn’t be any negotiations over his border levies. Trump’s goal of repatriating manufacturing was an inviolable priority, they said, and the purpose of the duties imposed in the name of reducing a trade deficit that Trump has declared a national emergency.\nThe weekend pullback on tech tariffs was the second major adjustment to Trump’s duty regime in a matter of days.\nOn April 9, the same day new duties unveiled the week before went into effect on dozens of countries, Trump abruptly reduced them all to 10% for 90 days — except for China — amid rapidly increasing concerns about a bond market selloff. There are also more signs that the tariffs and the growing odds of a recession that have come with them are politically unpopular.\nA CBS poll published Sunday found that a plurality of Americans expect Trump’s tariffs, which have raised the US’s average applied duties to their highest level in more than a century, to hurt their financial situation.\nThe administration is now focusing on negotiations with countries including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. The stated aim is to use the leverage Trump has built up with his tariffs to extract concessions that would open the door for more US exports or new investments in the US. While Trump has dropped tariff rates for those countries to 10% for 90 days to tee up talks, he hasn’t ruled out raising them again.\nHow successful talks will be remains unclear, as is what exactly Trump wants or how firm he will be in holding to a 10% baseline that he and aides had set as a floor.\nFlying to Florida on Friday evening, Trump called the 10% “pretty close” to a floor, but he didn’t rule out going lower. That has opened the door for countries to push for lower tariffs in their own negotiations, including with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic, who will meet his counterparts in Washington today.\nEuropean officials hope his trip will provide a better sense of the US’s willingness to negotiate and what its priorities are. But in spite of repeated calls for European unity, there’s no consensus on how far the bloc should go with concessions, or how to retaliate if talks fail.\nTrump’s weekend exclusion did not apply to the baseline 20% tariff he applied to China over fentanyl, and that levy remains in effect. China also has signaled so far that it is not interested in any negotiations.\nTrump’s unpredictability still hangs over any talks, as does his commitment to the idea of tariffs as an economic tool. Diplomats involved in discussions with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ahead of April 2 said even those cabinet members stressed privately that any agreement would still have to be approved by Trump and that they couldn’t guarantee his response.\nChip Strategy\nThe expected so-called Section 232 national security investigations that would lead to sectoral tariffs could take months. Friday’s exemption list provides the clearest sign yet of which products could be affected.\nOne key area is AI hardware, which the US imports primarily from Taiwan as well as Mexico, where a host of Taiwanese companies handle final assembly of products destined for the US.\nAI servers shipped from Mexico have so far escaped the tariffs, as much of that hardware falls under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement tariff exemption, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon.\nIf the eventual chip-sector tariffs do end up hitting servers, one guide for what’s to come may lie in Trump’s previous sectoral tariffs for autos and auto parts. Those products, subject to a 25% rate, are eligible for the USMCA exemption until the administration devises a process to impose tariffs on non US-content.\nBut for AI servers and all other products on the exemption list that contain chips — including consumer tech like phones and computers — there’s still a huge open question of whether the eventual duties would apply to the entire finished goods, or just the foreign-made chips they contain.\nBloomberg Tracker: Every Trump Tariff and Its Economic Effect\nTrump’s ultimate aim is to push more of the tech industry to rely on American supply chains. That would require a massive expansion of US chipmaking — something that’s already underway, thanks in large part to the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\nTrump, however, wants to scrap the bipartisan law, and his latest tariff moves could make it more expensive for companies to complete the factories they’ve announced. Based on Friday’s exemption list, the chip-sector tariffs could also hit manufacturing tools, which form the lion’s share of the price tag for new chip plants.\n--With assistance from Swati Pandey and Haslinda Amin.\n(Adds market info in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Beauty Salon Recession Indicator\nTrump Is Firing the Wrong People, on Purpose\nCheap Consumer Goods Are the American Dream, Actually\nWorld Travelers Are Rethinking Vacation Plans to the US\nHow One MBA Grad Blew the Whistle on a $2 Billion Deal\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer highlights.\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC’sSquawk on the Street, Jim Cramer analyzed the extraordinary market turnaround following President Trump’s unexpected 90-day tariff reprieve. Cramer explained just how abruptly the momentum changed:\n“The word that I kept hearing about is failed, that it would be a failed auction. It wasn’t. And therefore, it was a save. Once that save was made, in part because what the president did, you overrun what was the easiest trade of the year, which was the short Mag 7, short technology, short semiconductors, and everything reversed. Now, see, today, if you’re short – and the shorts are more or less the motif – they’re feeling good because it’s down, but they’re going to cover. They’re going to cover because they got hurt so badly yesterday that their bosses are saying, we want your books more. That’s historically what happens in these situations. So you may see all these down, but they’re not going to go back to where they were because we’re building in estimate cuts for everybody. And once they’re all built in, then it’s like 87. They’re all built in, and then you got to start figuring out. He was building too low.”\nREAD ALSO:Jim Cramer Questions Market Logic and Dissects These 7 Key StocksandJim Cramer Says Tariff Pain Isn’t Over Yet And Reviews These 9 Stocks\nHe also painted the market as a high-stakes showdown between short sellers and bulls, warning that the tide may have turned decisively:\n“It’s a great day for the longs, bad day for the shorts. […] What I’m talking about is that it’s a battle between longs and shorts. And the shorts are trying to keep their jobs after being victorious for so long. And the longs are revelling in what happened here because the 10%, except for, of course, what you talked about, which is the embargo.”\nFinally, Cramer credited a single Trump tweet with flipping the entire market narrative:\n“Yes, we are, given the fact that we should be in a hot seat estate, which is, we’re on a recession territory, ground, so whatever you want to say, until the tweet. Is that not insane? That a tweet came out and we went from being a recession to being up. […] The guy gave you the best call I’ve seen in my career, and yet there are people who are critical of that. I mean, come on. He got the Nasdaq to have the greatest single day ever, and he let you in. How many strategies have that kind of power? […]\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on April 10th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nIn the context of escalating tariffs and U.S.–China tensions, Jim Cramer examined the production risk facing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He argued that if Apple was given a long-term exemption or exit strategy, it could be a major blow to China while preserving Apple’s dominance. Here’s his analysis:\n“Last I heard, they still make most of their iPhones in China. They do, and some sent to Vietnam, but there are people in the White House who think that’s just trans-shipment. Put some screws in from China, and then, you know, boom. So you have the regular part, and then the screws, you know. They’re trying to make a discussion right now about exemption and Apple. It would be devastating to the Chinese if they gave Apple a year long extension to be able to move away because then Apple wouldn’t be hurt and Apple would know it have to leave. And that point we get to 2000. I mean what I hear is engineers who are crucial to Apple’s development and making [inaudible] they don’t want to let them leave.\nOverall, AAPLranks 1ston our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer highlights. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The firm's analysts, led by Brandon Nispel, said the risk tied to a worst-case tariff scenario has now eased.\nThey no longer expect Apple to hit their previously set downside price target. However, they warned challenges remain, including high investor expectations for fiscal 2026, concerns around Apple's approach to artificial intelligence, and potential fallout from the ongoing Justice Department case involving Google.\nMeanwhile, Wedbush reiterated its Outperform rating and $250 price target. Analyst Daniel Ives and his team outlined four key implications of the tariff news: Apple has limited time to recalibrate its supply chainIndia likely being the focus for ramping up production; it now avoids immediate steep price hikes for U.S. consumers; tech components may get special regulatory treatment; and the anticipated tariffs appear manageable in the near term.\nWedbush noted that while the base China tariff will still apply, markets had already priced that in.

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nTech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Palantir (PLTR) are trading higher as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gains onexpectations of tariff changes, including exemptions on certain consumer electronics. While mixed messaging has come out of the White House, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte tellsBrad SmithandMadison Millson Morning Brief that he views tariff exemptions on smartphones as \"semi-permanent.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere.\nTech stocks are higher today after shifting messages from the Trump administration over the weekend. According to the latest developments, smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics will be exempt from President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. But the tech products will face sector specific levies in the near future. Joining us now, we've got Tom Forte, who is the Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst. Tom, good to see you this morning. So how are you making sense of the tariffs on tech right now and who it's going to impact the most?\nYeah, so stepping back for a minute, I think we're in a very fluid situation. I think the strategy that President Trump is employing here is he's trying to reduce the trade deficit, he's trying to reduce the budget deficit. He's trying to bring some manufacturing back to the US. The challenge for everyone is to try to determine what does this look like on a near-term basis and what does this look like on a long-term basis. So I think that when it comes to Apple, uh, Tim Cook has a wonderful relationship with President Trump. Also has a wonderful relationship with President Xi. Uh, but it isn't clear to me at this point in time what the ultimate outcome for Apple will be, but I would almost view the exemption on smartphones as semi-permanent. Meaning that I think that there is going to be some sort of exemption as it pertains to smartphones and things made out of China. And my overriding view is that the markets uh view of Apple's shares has been too negative, that the outcome may be less bad than feared and this is an example of that.\nSo Tom, as as you know, it over the weekend, there was a little bit of whiplash, right? We had this uh reporting that the reciprocal tariffs were off for smartphones, computers, a lot of tech products, but then President Trump and Secretary Howard Luttner saying sectoral tariffs are on and they're coming in the next month or two. Where does that net out for Apple? I hear you saying you think there's going to be a smartphone exemption, but did I misread President Trump's posts talking about how nobody would be off the hook here? You still think there's going to be that exemption?\nYeah, so I'm glad you used the term whiplash. So as someone who's followed the industry since 96, I feel like I have whiplash and indigestion. I mean, it's a very challenging market right now. I think that the one of the reasons though the market is so challenging is it's responding to every headline and it's not thinking about what's beyond the headlines. What's the ultimate strategy here? And the ultimate strategy here is this is, I think when we say tariffs, we really should say trade negotiations. This is a trade negotiation going on between US and China. Uh it isn't clear to me what the ultimate trade deal might look like, but this is a negotiation. You've seen it on both sides. So you had the original tariff announcements by President Trump, you had retaliatory response by China, and there's a bit of a back and forth. So I think it's better to frame it as a trade negotiation rather than to look at each individual headline and assume that's the final outcome.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\n(Bloomberg) -- Global technology stocks climbed Monday after the Trump administration provided crucial albeit fleeting tariff relief for battered electronics and semiconductor makers.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Secret Formula for Faster Trains\nHow Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit?\nNYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six\nEven Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem\nLisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City’s Housing Shortage\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday published measures exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. That helped fuel a 4.4% rally in shares of Apple Inc., and a 3.2% gain across Europe’s tech sector.\nThe relief is crucial for Apple, whose products rely heavily on supply chain partners in China. Chip-equipment companies like ASML Holding NV also dodged the tariff threat for now. Although Trump said the exemptions will be temporary, some investors are optimistic that the reprieve may open a window for companies and lobbyists to seek better terms.\n“The market is trying to look through the noise and assuming we will end up in a negotiated endgame that is more favorable than current terms,” said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management in Sydney. Still, “the amount of conflicting statements and policy on the run makes it impossible to trade short term.”\nUS chipmakers broadly advanced, with Nvidia Corp. rising 0.76% and Micron Technology Inc. gaining 3.7%. Computer makers Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. rallied, while consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. rose 4.1%.\nAn MSCI gauge of tech stocks in Asia Pacific edged up by 0.8%. In Taiwan, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. closed up 3%. Hong Kong-listed PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd., which gets about one-third of its sales from the Americas, also gained.\nFriday’s exemptions — published by US Customs and Border Protection — narrowed the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariffs and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries. A 20% tariff still applies to electronics shipped from China.\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that it was only a pause, though the new tech levies will almost certainly be lower than the 125% rate on China. Trump later said that details on a tariff rate for semiconductors would be announced in the coming week.\n“I think it is ‘net’ reprieve, as the bet that electronics will still be less than the 125% reciprocal on China and that companies get to build buffers now,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank.\nAnalysts warned that uncertainties around the tech sector remain high with new levies yet to be announced. Results due this week from ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will also be key as investors gauge the impact of tariffs on the supply chain for artificial intelligence chips.\n“The tariff environment is changing constantly. Semiconductors remain in limbo as we wait for the Section 301 investigation to finalize potential tariffs,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note.\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Subrat Patnaik and Phil Serafino.\n(Updates share prices and chart at US market open.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nKeyBanc upgradedApple(AAPL)to Sector Weight from Underweight without a price target. Last Friday's announcement of exception from tariffs on smartphones is probably the best-case scenario for Apple, which makes it unlikely KeyBanc's prior downside call will be achieved, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBaird upgradedAtlassian(TEAM)to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $255, down from $320. The firm cites Atlassian's platform opportunity, positive receptivity to its generative artificial intelligence strategy, and a valuation at the lower end of the stock's historical range for the upgrade.\nDeutsche Bank upgradedPeloton(PTON)to Buy from Hold with a price target of $6.60, down from $8.60. The firm believes the shares have been \"unfairly punished\" since the fiscal Q2 report, down over 30%.\nKeyBanc upgradedDuPont(DD)to Overweight from Sector Weight with an $81 price target. The firm cites the selloff in the shares and the Trump administration's recent steps on deescalating the tariff uncertainty for the upgrade.\nGoldman Sachs double upgradedChoice Hotels(CHH)to Buy from Sell with a price target of $138, down from $141. With an increasingly uncertain demand backdrop, Choice Hotels is one of the most defensive names in the sector given its largely franchise revenue structure and \"solid\" balance sheet, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nDeutsche Bank downgradedWayfair(W)to Hold from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $54. Wayfair's business model is \"by far the most upended by the new tariff regime\" in the internet group, as evidenced by the shares declining 42% since earnings, the firm notes.\nDeutsche Bank downgradedGeneral Motors(GM)to Hold from Buy with a $43 price target. While stating that the stock already trades at a low multiple, the firm worries GM \"may be an impaired asset for several years\" given structural uncertainty around U.S. industrial and tariff policy.\nWells Fargo downgradedComcast(CMCSA)to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $31, down from $37. The firm says Comcast is being pulled into a convergence investment cycle with higher mobile costs to re-accelerate broadband, and says it is no longer defensive.\nGoldman Sachs downgradedMarriott(MAR)to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $245, down from $313. The firm expects the recent macro volatility and consumer pressures to be a headwind to the \"macro sensitive segments.\" Goldman also downgraded Hilton(HLT)and Hyatt(H)to Neutral from Buy.\nTD Cowen downgradedMedpace(MEDP)to Hold from Buy with a price target of $328, down from $370. The firm cites the challenging biotech funding and uncertain regulatory environment for the downgrade.\nTop 5 Initiations:\nBernstein initiated coverage ofToyota(TM)with a Market Perform rating. The firm initiated the Japan autos and auto parts sector with a bearish view. While sector-wide valuations already reflect a cautious outlook with declining sales and loss in market share, Bernstein sees greater need to be selective in this space given geopolitical risks in short term and the electrified propulsion vehicle transition in mid-to-long term. The firm also started coverage of Honda(HMC)with a Market Perform.\nMorgan Stanley initiated coverage ofDover(DOV)with an Equal Weight rating and $185 price target. The company's organic growth should outpace peers in 2025 as it laps \"acute headwinds,\" but Morgan Stanley is yet to see signs that its mid-single-digit organic growth is durable. The firm also started coverage of Ametek(AME)and Watsco(WSO)with Equal Weight ratings.\nWells Fargo initiated coverage ofSailPoint(SAIL)with an Equal Weight rating and $16 price target. The firm believes the lack of a platform will limit the company's long-term growth below 20%, which in turn should limit the stock's multiple.\nStephens initiated coverage ofCNB Financial(CCNE)with an Overweight rating and $26.50 price target. The firm believes the $6.2B, soon to be $8.5B, western Pennsylvania franchise is \"a strong, but not well-known story,\" with the potential for net interest margin expansion with the soon-to-be-closed ESSA Bancorp(ESSA)acquisition.\nNeedham initiated coverage ofEstablishment Labs(ESTA)with a Hold rating and no price target. The firm says Establishment's international business has been weak, and that it worries the trade war could weigh on its international growth.",

        "body":"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.\nApple (AAPL) stock surged 4.5% in Monday afternoon trading after U.S. Customs and Border Protection announceda temporary exemption for smartphones, laptops, and other electronicsfrom President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 145% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods.\nIt’s the kind of move that reverberates well beyond Cupertino. Apple has a market capitalization of $3 trillion — meaning the almost 7% jump it saw in premarket trading translates into a staggering $200 billion increase in market capitalization.\nFor perspective, that’s more than the total market cap of Intel (INTC), Caterpillar (CAT), or Goldman Sachs (GS). That number is nearly equivalent to the GDP of Greece or New Zealand. And because Apple is the largest by weight in the S&P 500, the ripple effect of a move like this can sway the entire index.\nWhen Apple moves almost 7%, it’s not just a stock story — it’s a seismic event for global markets.\nOn Monday afternoon, Trump left the door open to Apple receiving temporary tariff exemptions on products manufactured in China.\n“I’m a very flexible person,” Trump said in the White House in response to a reporter’s question about potential exemptions for Apple products. “I’ll speak to Tim Cook.”\nOther tech companies exposed to Chinese manufacturing, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Dell (DELL), both also rallied on Monday. Nvidia was up 0.3%, while Dell climbed 4.8%.\nBut the celebration may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that smartphones and similar devices are still slated to be included in a forthcoming semiconductor-focused tariff round “coming in probably a month or two.”\nTrump echoed that ambiguity on social media, insisting no product was actually exempt and calling the change a simple reclassification.\n“Look, there is no tariff policy. It’s just all chaos and corruption. That’s all we have going on,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said during aTV appearanceSunday.\nWall Street analysts say the muddled messaging adds to investor unease, particularly for companies with deep supply chain ties to China. The bottom line: The exemptions may delay pain, but they don’t erase it.\nEven amid policy uncertainty, Apple’s core business continues to flex its strength. The company retook the global top spot in smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025, buoyed by strong demand for the iPhone 16e in Japan and India.\nWith both hardware traction and brand loyalty still going strong, Apple’s grip on the high end of the global market remains unshaken — for now.\nFor the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram.",
